tests/test_bridged_aromatic_ene.py

Tests for the fused-aromatic / bridged hybrid VB naming path in
``iupac_namer/ring_naming/bridged.py`` (commit 9ed2f2a).

The logic under test:

1. ``_detect_vb_unsaturation`` Kekulizes a work-copy of the molecule when the
   ring system contains aromatic atoms so that aromatic bonds surface as
   explicit double bonds and can be emitted as ``-ene`` locants.

2. ``_format_vb_locant`` emits the IUPAC P-23 disambiguated form
   ``"lo(hi)"`` whenever the bond is NOT on the principal numbering edge
   (i.e. ``hi != lo + 1``).  This is required for cross-bridge / wrap-around
   aromatic bonds, otherwise OPSIN reads the locant as a principal-path bond
   and builds a molecule with the wrong valence.

All expected names are OPSIN-round-trip verified (constitutional match).
