"""The plan search's budget, and the starvation it used to allow.

**A TRUNCATED SEARCH IS NOT A DECISION.** The engine enumerates candidate
naming plans and then ranks them, so a plan that is never generated cannot
lose on the merits -- it simply is not there, and the output is whatever the
survivors happened to include. That failure is invisible from the name: the
answer looks like a considered choice.

Measured 2026-09-17 over the 227 benchmark molecules: a single plan counter
capped at 20 was REACHED by 67 of the 189 that produce a top-level trace, and
in the worst cases all 20 slots went to ONE parent's numbering variants.
`phenyltrimethylsilane` was named `(trimethylsilan-yl)benzene` for that
reason alone -- the silicon parent scores 5000 against benzene's 561 and
would have won instantly, but no silicon plan was ever proposed. D-032 in
`test_namer_known_defects.py` pins the four names; this file pins the
*mechanism*, because the names could come back right for the wrong reason.

What is asserted here is the contract, not the constants. `_PlanBudget` may
be retuned; what must not change is that one parent hypothesis cannot consume
the budget a different hypothesis needs.

These tests build real `SubstitutivePlan` objects rather than stand-ins. The
first draft used a fake class and every fake landed in ONE bucket, because
the key reads a candidate only for a plan type that HAS one -- which is a
fact about the engine worth stating rather than a wrinkle to work around.
Only `SubstitutivePlan` carries a `named_parent`; `FunctionalClassPlan`,
`MultiplicativePlan`, `RingAssemblyPlan` and the rest have no parent
candidate at all, so they are keyed by class and share one bucket per class.
That is coarser than the substitutive case on purpose: the tier ordering in
`_generate_all_plans` already runs those handlers first so a substitutive
plan space cannot starve them, and the measured maximum total is 138 plans
against a 512 bound, so the coarse bucket has never bound anything.
