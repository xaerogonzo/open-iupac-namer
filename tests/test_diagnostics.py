"""Tests for the opt-in naming diagnostics (``iupac_namer.diagnostics``).

The instrument exists to find one specific failure shape: a charged
molecule whose motif no classifier claims, or whose renderer declines, is
handed back to the generic plan search -- which neutralizes it and names
the neutral skeleton.  The caller gets a confident wrong answer.

These tests pin two things that are easy to break by accident:

1. **It is off unless asked for.**  The perception layer documents "no
   module-level mutable state" as an invariant, and instrumentation that
   ran by default would both violate the spirit of that and cost a
   canonicalisation per charged molecule.
2. **It attributes the decline to the right gate.**  ``unclaimed`` means
   a classifier needs writing; ``render_failed`` means an existing
   renderer needs extending.  That distinction is invisible from the
   wrong name alone, and getting it backwards sends the fix to the wrong
   layer.
