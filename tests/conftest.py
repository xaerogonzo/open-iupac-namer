tests/conftest.py

Test-suite fixtures and Windows-specific py2opsin hardening.

py2opsin (used by several round-trip tests) writes to a fixed temp file
``py2opsin_temp_input.txt`` in the current working directory and removes
it in a ``finally`` block.  On Windows the underlying Java process can
hold the file handle for a few hundred milliseconds after subprocess
completion (often due to antivirus scanning), causing
``PermissionError: [WinError 32]`` on the ``os.remove`` call and making
otherwise-deterministic tests flaky.

This conftest wraps :func:`py2opsin.py2opsin` once at session start with
a guarded variant that:

* Retries the temp-file removal a handful of times (with short sleeps),
  swallowing the error if the file ultimately cannot be removed (it will
  simply be overwritten on the next call).
* Optionally retries the entire OPSIN call once if the first call returns
  empty output, which can happen when a stale ``java.exe`` from a prior
  run is still holding the temp file open.

The wrapper is a no-op on non-Windows platforms or when ``py2opsin`` is
not importable.
