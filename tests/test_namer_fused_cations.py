"""Naming round 33 (D-205): the cation of a fused ring system is named from its neutral twin when the cation itself matches no table.

The fused namers read the ring from the molecule. The cation of a ring system whose neutral parent has ONE indicated hydrogen (`c1c[n+]2c([nH]1)[nH]c1ccccc12`, the cation
of imidazo[1,2-a][1,3]benzimidazole; any protonated pyridine-type nitrogen of a fused heteroaromatic: `[nH+]` beside an `[nH]`) is a molecule no table holds, so
`name_ring_system` returned nothing and the name was `[NAMING ERROR: No valid naming plan found for ...]`: 8 of 300 protonated fused heteroaromatics, and 7 of the census's
2000 rows. A ring system with nothing to offer that carries an aromatic nitrogen cation is tried once more on a neutral copy (`ring_naming._neutral_twin`); the `-ium` is
rendered afterwards from the full molecule, and the atom indices are the same. It only runs where the first pass found nothing, so no name that existed can move.

Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
