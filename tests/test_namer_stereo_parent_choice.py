"""One stereoisomer, one name, when the parent can be any of several chains that differ only in configuration (P-44.4.1.12).

The Blue Book's own example for CIP Sequence Rule 4b (P-92.5.2.2 example 5, BlueBookV2.pdf p. 900) is a molecule with six equal
arms, three on each of two quaternary carbons joined through a carbinol. Any arm at each end can be the chain, so there are nine
chains, all `nonan-5-ol` and all the same constitution; they differ in the configuration of the stereocentres they carry. The book
names the one whose descriptors are `(2R,3R,5R,7R,8R)`. Measured 2026-10-06 over random spellings of that ONE stereoisomer (each
spelling checked to be it by InChIKey):

    master 66f112ed                              8 names over 10 spellings
    + the cache fix (#229)                      16 names over 30
    + the "R precedes S" follow-up (#232)        4 names over 30
    + this change                                1 name  over 40, the book's

The first row hid two defects, and only the second is this file's:

* **A substituent's tree was reused for a different substituent** (#229, `context_stereo_key`): a (2R,3R) arm was printed (2S,3R)
  because both arms print as one SMILES once cut from the chain. That is a name for another compound. After it, every descriptor
  in every one of the 16 names is RDKit's label for the atom it describes: those are 16 CORRECT names of one molecule, each on a
  different chain, which is why a round trip or a per-descriptor check cannot see this defect and a count of names can.
* **The chain was chosen by atom order.** #232 added the choice of parent by configuration (`_break_parent_stereo_tie`: "like before
  unlike, then r before s, then R before S", P-44.4.1.12.2, BlueBookV2.pdf p. 413), and it did not engage here, for two reasons it
  could not have seen on the diether and diamide it was built on:
    1. It named every tied parent side by side, up to four, and there are nine. Only FOUR are different: the two arms of a
       quaternary carbon that carry the same configuration are one choice, since either gives the same name.
    2. It compared two parents only when their names were equal "once the descriptors are set aside", by removing the descriptors
       from the FINISHED text. The descriptors decide how prefixes merge, so the chain through one arm reads `4,4-bis[(2S,3R)-...]` and
       the chain through another `4-[(2R,3R)-...]-4-[(2S,3R)-...]`: different texts for names that differ in nothing but configuration.

Both are fixed at the cause: `engine._plan_identity` counts parents the molecule's own symmetry cannot tell apart once, and
`assembly.assemble_without_stereo` sets the descriptors aside while the name is assembled, so the prefixes merge as they would
without them. The choice itself is #232's, unchanged.

The oracle is RDKit's `rdCIPLabeler` on the WHOLE molecule, not a name: every descriptor the engine prints for the parent, and for
each prefix through the `atom_origin` that maps the prefix's own atoms back, must be that label for that atom, and the stereocentres
so described must be exactly the labelled ones, each once. OPSIN cannot read the book's name ("Failed to assign CIP stereochemistry"),
so it is no oracle here.
