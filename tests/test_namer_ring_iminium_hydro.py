"""Naming round 34 (D-207): a partly saturated ring whose nitrogen is cationic keeps its hydro prefixes.

A monocyclic ring cation with a C=N+ in it (a protonated cyclic imine, an N-alkyl iminium, a cyclic amidinium: `C1CC=[NH+]C1`, `C[N+]1=C(C)NCC1`, `CC1=[NH+]CCCC1`) was named
as the FULLY unsaturated or fully saturated ring with an `-ium`, a different molecule: `azol-1-ium` (an aromatic pyrrolium), `2,3-dimethyl-1,3-diazol-3-ium` (an
imidazolium), `azinan-1-ium` (piperidinium). Two refusals in the same shape caused it. `monocyclic._collect_hydro_locants` returned nothing on the first charged ring atom,
although a ring N+ in a double bond is no hydro position, and `retained_lookup._try_derive_hydro_retained` did the same for the pyridine family and then looked the ring up
as the CATION entry (`pyridinium`), which is no parent for hydro prefixes; a charged ring is now looked up on its neutral copy first.

Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
