"""Naming round 28: a name must keep every nuclide the molecule has (D-193), and the placement and readability of the labels (D-195, D-196).

`[15NH2]c1ccccc1` was named `aniline`, `[15N]#CCC(=O)O` `cyanoacetic acid`, `C[18O]CC(=O)O` `methoxyacetic acid`: each a name for the UNLABELLED compound, with nothing in
the output to say a label was lost. `collect_isotope_labels` drops a label for an atom it cannot locate ("drop the label rather than emit a guess"), and `isotopic_prefix`
labelled only a prefix that is one atom, so every route that builds a name from parts of the molecule could lose a nuclide without anyone knowing.

The fix is two things, and they are tested apart:

* **the guard** (`engine._check_nuclides_named`), a net under EVERY route: a name that cites fewer atoms of a nuclide than the molecule has is refused, so the next
  route nobody has found raises instead of denoting another compound;
* **the routes** that label their atoms: a retained parent's unnumbered atom (`(15N)aniline`, `(18O)phenol`, `(15N)benzonitrile`), a multi-atom prefix (`(15N)cyano`,
  `(81Br)bromocarbonyl`), an ether oxygen (`(18O)methoxy`), the halogen of a hypohalous amide, an isotopic hydrogen on a hydroxy or amino prefix (`(O-2H)hydroxy`), the
  heteroatom of a suffix group (`1-phenylethan-1-(18O)one`), and the parent's own bracket placed before the part it modifies (`1-bromo(4-13C)butane`, D-196).

Every name pinned here was read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey (isotopes are in the InChIKey).
