"""Tests for Stage 14 R14-B + Stage 15 R15-A: isocyano prefix detection.

R14-B: adds the ``isocyano`` (-N#C with formal charges [N+]#[C-]) prefix-only
functional group recognised on aryl substrates via the standard prefix-only
FG path (alongside nitro/nitroso/azido).

R15-A: closes the alkyl substrate path by extending the prefix-FG exclusion
in ``perception/__init__.py`` candidate-parent generation to skip ANY N+
that is a member of any prefix-only FG (anchor or otherwise).  Pre-fix the
isocyano [N+] still leaked through an anchor-only check (its anchor is the
[C-]) and the parent search picked it as an azanium parent over the
substrate carbon, emitting ``(R)(methylidyne)azanium``.  Post-fix all
substrates (alkyl/aryl/cycloalkyl) name as ``isocyano-R``.
