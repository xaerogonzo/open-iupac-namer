"""Naming round 5 (N7): a numbering choice must not depend on how the
structure was written.

The hydro-orientation defect (D-092) was a TIE broken by enumeration order,
which is exactly the kind of choice that moves when the input's atom order
does. Each N7 case is named from shuffled atom orders, a Kekule SMILES and
randomly rooted SMILES, and must come out identical every time.
