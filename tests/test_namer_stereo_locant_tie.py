"""P-14.4 (j): when two numberings tie on everything else, R takes the lower locant (and Z, M, r), not whichever the atom order gave.

`C[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)O` (meso butane-2,3-diol) was `(2R,3S)-` or `(2S,3R)-butane-2,3-diol` by the order its atoms were written
in. Both read back to the same structure, so nothing failed and no corpus row could see it; the name was simply not a
function of the molecule. The two numberings tied on every tier of the preference key and on P-14.4 (g), and fell to plan
generation order, which follows atom order. The Blue Book settles it (BlueBookV2.pdf p. 79, criterion (j) of P-14.4): of each
pair of CIP descriptors, Z, R, M and r take the lower locant; the units' locants are compared first and the descriptors in
locant order after, the first point of difference deciding. It is the LAST criterion, after (g).

It is applied in `engine._break_alphanumerical_tie`, between numberings of one parent: a chain, a ring, and the `-diyl` group of a
polyol's diester (`(2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diyl diacetate`, naming round 26).

It is deliberately NOT applied in `engine._break_ester_tie`, the choice of which ester of a polyester is principal. A tier was
built there and removed: the alcohol component is named as a fragment of its own, and when two ester plans carve fragments that
print alike one of the two trees can carry descriptors that do not describe the molecule. Ranking those trees R-first picked the
wrong one: meso dipropylene glycol diacetate came out as the R,R compound. `test_every_stereoisomer_of_these_diesters_reads_back`
is the guard, and it is the reason this file reads names back instead of only comparing them.
