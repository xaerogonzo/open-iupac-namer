Tests for parent-CIP inheritance on carved substituents (commits 32cb5e7 and
6bf250a).

Background
----------
When ``carve_substituent`` cuts a substituent off the parent mol, the
parent-side neighbour of the attachment atom is replaced with H.  Two
consequences for CIP:

1. At the attachment atom itself: it used to have a real neighbour (N/C/O
   etc.), now it has H.  If the atom was a stereocenter, RDKit may no
   longer perceive it as one at all (two H's → not a stereocenter).
   Commit ``32cb5e7`` fixes this by stashing ``_ParentCIPCode`` on the
   attachment atom and having ``StereoAnalysis._detect_tetrahedral`` emit
   a virtual tetrahedral stereocenter using that property.

2. At atoms INSIDE the carved substituent (2+ bonds from attachment):
   RDKit can still perceive them as stereocenters, but the CIP priority
   ranking may flip because the parent-side chain no longer contributes
   to ranking.  IUPAC P-92.1.4.3 says the free valence is treated as a
   phantom atom of the parent's identity, so the in-parent CIP descriptor
   should be reported.  Commit ``6bf250a`` extends the stash to EVERY
   parent atom that has a ``_CIPCode``, and propagates to every carved
   fragment atom via the parent-idx → fragment-idx map.

These tests exercise both cases with small peptide-like and polyol SMILES.
All expected names are OPSIN-round-trip verified with stereo preserved.
