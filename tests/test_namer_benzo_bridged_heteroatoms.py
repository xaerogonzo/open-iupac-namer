"""Naming round 32 (D-204): a benzo-fused bridged ring system with a ring heteroatom is not a carbocycle's name.

`ring_naming.benzo_fused_bridged` names `<hydro>-<bridge>-methano-benzocyclo[N]ene`, a CARBOCYCLE, and never looked at an atom's element: a ring oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur in
the macrocycle was dropped without a word. The Biginelli-type adducts `CC(=O)C1C(=O)NC2(C)CC1c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1O2` (a 2,6-methano-1,3-benzoxazocine) came out as
`6-acetyl-9-methyl-3-nitro-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-5,9-methanobenzocycloocten-7-one`, which OPSIN reads as a carbocycle with no oxygen and no nitrogen: a different molecule, and
both census rows of this shape were wrong. The module now declines a system whose non-benzene atoms are not all carbon, and the generic bridged path names it, with its replacement
prefixes (`8-oxa-10-azatricyclo[7.3.1.0^{2,7}]trideca-2,4,6-trien-11-one`).

The preferred name is the fusion-bridged one (`2,6-methano-1,3-benzoxazocine`, P-25.4); that is not built, so these are valid, non-preferred names.
Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
