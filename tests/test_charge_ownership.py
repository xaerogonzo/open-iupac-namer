"""Who owns a formally charged atom: exactly one route, or a visible hole.

Naming round 7 found that a carboxylate beside a neutral OH had NO owner: the
classifier deferred it to plan search and plan search excluded it in favour of
the classifier. `perception/charge_ownership.py` makes ownership something a test
can assert, and this file holds the two failure shapes as permanent tests rather
than one-off mutations:

* a ZERO-owner state (the hole this round started from);
* a TWO-owner state (the failure the next fix is likeliest to introduce: both
  routes claim, and whichever runs first wins).

Everything here is static except the `observed` cross-checks, which run the real
engine (not OPSIN) and compare the route it actually took with the route the static
claim predicts. The static view mirrors exactly one route (`fg_anion`), and that
cross-check is what would notice the mirror drifting.
