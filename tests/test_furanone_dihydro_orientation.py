"""Regression tests for the furanone / thiophenone oxo-dihydro LOCANT
orientation fix (P-31.1.4.1.1 / P-31.1.4.3.4).

Root cause
----------
A monocyclic mancude 5-ring O/S heterocycle that carries BOTH a ring carbonyl
(``C=O``) and a higher-seniority principal characteristic group (e.g. ``-COOH``)
must be numbered so the senior group gets the lowest locant.  That forces the
ring carbonyl to be cited as an ``oxo`` PREFIX (not the ``-one`` suffix) and
shifts the actually-saturated ring atoms to new locants.

The engine matched the curated bare-skeleton entry ``2,3-dihydrofuran`` and
emitted ``5-oxo-2,3-dihydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid`` — but that name describes a
DIFFERENT (more saturated) structure: OPSIN reads ``2,3-dihydro`` literally as
saturation at positions 2 and 3, contradicting the C=C present between 2-3.  The
correct PIN is ``5-oxo-4,5-dihydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid`` (C=C at 2-3, the CH2
at 4 and the carbonyl carbon at 5 are the saturated/added-H positions).

Fix
---
``_try_derive_hydro_retained`` gained an ``include_oxo_carbons_as_saturation``
mode that counts a ring carbon bearing exactly one exocyclic suffix-eligible
double bond (=O/=S/=Se/=Te/=NR) as a saturation (added-H) position — lifting
that doublet off as an oxo-class prefix turns the carbon into a saturated ring
member, so it joins the dihydro count.  Section 5c of ``try_retained_name``
invokes this mode for curated 5-ring dihydro entries and offers the re-oriented
``<locs>-dihydro<parent>`` forms as extra candidates, BUT only when the dihydro
locant SET differs from the curated form's set (so the symmetric
``2,5-dihydrofuran`` case is untouched and the carbonyl stays the lowest-locant
suffix when it IS the principal group).

Tests use the project's authoritative round-trip criterion: feed our emitted
name to OPSIN and compare canonical SMILES.
