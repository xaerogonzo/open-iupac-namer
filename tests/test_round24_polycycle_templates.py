"""Naming round 24 (D-180): the polycycle templates in fusion_general.POLYCYCLES.

`heptalene` was written as a 13-atom [8, 7] skeleton, so it never matched a
real heptalene; fusion naming then fell back to `cyclohepta[7]annulene` as the
parent and named colchicine's benzo[a]heptalene core "benzocyclohepta[7]annulene",
a name OPSIN reads as a different structure (the app withheld it).

The table below is (atom count, ring sizes) read from OPSIN's parse of each
template's own name on 2026-10-05, so a template cannot drift from the
parent it is named for. The check is on the skeleton (all bonds single).
