"""An O- or S-bonded cyano group is cyanato / thiocyanato, and NOT a nitrile.

Found by a cross-check of the engine's perception against an independent
functional-group vocabulary (naming round 6): the engine's nitrile pattern is
blind to what the cyano carbon is bonded to, so it and the prefix-only
`cyanato` / `thiocyanato` groups overlapped on the C#N atoms. The engine logged
"Unknown FG overlap ... Treating as ambiguity" and the nitrile won, so methyl
thiocyanate was PERCEIVED as a nitrile of methane. The subsumption entries in
`perception/fg_detection.py` are what these tests pin; they are observable in
perception even where the names do not change.

(The repository this package is vendored into keeps the same test against its
own annotation layer; this copy reads the engine's `Perception` directly, since
that layer cannot exist here.)
