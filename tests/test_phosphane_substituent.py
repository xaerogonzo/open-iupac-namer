"""Tests for phosphanyl-sulfanyl ether prefix bracketing fix.

When a P-containing fragment (like di(methoxy)(oxo)phosphanyl) is named as
a substituent via an S or O bridge, the compound substituent name must be
enclosed in square brackets before the bridge suffix to prevent OPSIN from
misinterpreting the S/O as the central atom.

Correct:   [di(methoxy)(oxo)phosphanyl]sulfanyl
Incorrect: di(methoxy)(oxo)phosphanylsulfanyl  (OPSIN reads S as centre)

See: Cluster 6 of the triage (ZT-2532, ZT-2264, ZT-2644, ZT-2425).

        # The subject is BRACKETING: a P-containing compound substituent must
        # be enclosed before the `sulfanyl` bridge or OPSIN reads the S as the
        # centre. That needs a molecule where P really is a SUBSTITUENT, and
        # the three original inputs no longer are: with the plan-budget fix
        # the phosphorus parent is finally proposed, and P-44.1.2 prefers it
        # over the carbocycle (BlueBookV2.pdf p. 375 -- carbon is last in the
        # element order, and the criterion explicitly chooses between rings
        # and chains). `CCOP(=S)(CC)Sc1ccccc1` is now
        # `(ethoxy)(ethyl)(phenylsulfanyl)(thioxo)phosphane`, which has no
        # phosphanyl substituent to bracket. It still round-trips on both
        # gates; see the `_unchanged` test below.
        #

        # an amine, a carboxylic acid -- so the carbon chain is the parent by
        # P-44.1.1, which outranks the senior-atom criterion. That makes the
        # phosphanyl substituent appear deliberately rather than incidentally,
