"""Stage 1 fused-ring naming: ortho-fused two-component systems where the
smaller partner is a 5-ring with a [1,3]-dihetero pattern (dioxolo, dithiolo,
oxathiolo, ...).

These tests verify that:
  1. The new fused-ring naming module produces the expected
     ``[1,3]<prefix>[4,5-<letter>]<base>`` form for cases where no retained
     name applies.
  2. Each generated name round-trips correctly through OPSIN to the same
     canonical SMILES as the input.
  3. Existing retained names (e.g. 1,3-benzodioxole) are still preferred
     over the new systematic form (architectural priority preserved).

# NAMING ROUND 5 (N3) moved every expectation in this file, and the book says
# why. Three rules, each with the page it is printed on:
#
#   * Indicated hydrogen is part of a PIN. The CH2 between the two
#     heteroatoms cannot take a ring double bond, so the name says where that
#     hydrogen is: "2H-furo[2,3-d][1,3]dioxole (PIN)" (pdf p. 218);
#     "Omission of indicated hydrogen is also permitted in general
#     nomenclature ... for example 1,3-benzodioxole, rather than
#     2H-1,3-benzodioxole" (P-25.7.1.3.1, p. 260).
#   * A benzene fused to a heteromonocycle is ONE component, named
#     "benzo...": "4H-3,1-benzoxazine (PIN)", not "[1,3]oxazino[4,5-b]benzene"
#     (P-25.2.2.4, p. 207).
#   * The heterocycle is the parent: "2H-naphtho[2,3-d][1,3]dioxole", as the
#     book's "2H-furo[2,3-d][1,3]dioxole (PIN)" (P-25.3.2.4 (a), p. 218).
