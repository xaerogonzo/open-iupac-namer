"""Naming round 30: the two oxygens of a carboxyl group are different atoms, and a suffix cites only the atoms it names.

Round 29 (phase 2) left three things in its sweep of 400 labelled census molecules, all of them a label cited in the wrong place or twice:

* **D-197**: the carbonyl oxygen and the hydroxyl oxygen of an acid, which is also the alkoxy oxygen of the ester the acid component is carved from, were both
  `(1-18O)`: `CC(=[18O])OC` and `CC(=O)[18O]C` were both `methyl (1-18O)acetate`, two molecules under one name that OPSIN reads as neither. OPSIN reads the
  carbonyl oxygen as `(18O)acetate` / `-1-(18O)oate` and the hydroxyl or alkoxy oxygen, cited with the element as its locant, as `(O-18O)acetate` / `-1-(O-18O)oate`;
* **D-200**: a ketone's group lists its two NEIGHBOURS among its atoms and only its oxygen is named by `-one`, so the nitrogen of `CC(=O)N1CCCCC1` was cited by its ring
  AND by the ketone, `1-[(1-15N)piperidin-1-yl]ethan-1-(15N)one`: two 15N for one, a wrong molecule. The aryl carbon an acetyl hangs on was cited the same way;
* **D-201**: a nuclide between the locant and the suffix word hid the vowel from the elision, `prop-2-ene-1-(18O)amide` where the book's unlabelled
  `prop-2-enamide` and `prop-2-en-1-ol` lose the infix's e.

* **D-202**: a nuclide in a FUSED ring system defeated every ring namer that read the ring from the molecule rather than through `extract_ring_mol`: `[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine`
  with a labelled bridgehead nitrogen was `[NAMING ERROR ...]`, as were eleven of 300 census molecules with one ring nitrogen labelled. `ring_naming.name_ring_system` now looks the
  ring up without its nuclides, for every kind of ring at once; the label is placed afterwards from the full molecule.

Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
