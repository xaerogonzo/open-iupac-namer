"""Naming round 31 (D-203): the indicated hydrogen of a hydro-named ring ketone is the planner's, not the retained lookup's placeholder.

The retained lookup writes the parent's DEFAULT indicated hydrogen into its text: for a purine whose C5 and N9 are saturated and whose C6 is a carbonyl it wrote
`5,9-dihydro-2H-purine`, where C2 is sp2 and C6 is the carbonyl. The P-58.2 planner (`indicated_hydrogen_p58.plan_hydrogens`) puts the indicated hydrogen where the
book does, on the carbon that carries the group (`5,9-dihydro-6H-purin-6-one`), but `_resolve` checked the OLD text against its plan, found an atom (the 2) that the plan
did not describe, and declined, so the placeholder reached the name: `8-(methylsulfanyl)-5,9-dihydro-2H-purin-6-one`, which OPSIN reads as ANOTHER molecule (a CH2 at C2).
The check now ignores the old text's indicated-hydrogen labels and keeps the hydro ones, which are read off the structure.

Found in round 30, where a labelled sweep called it a label defect: the UNLABELLED name was already another molecule. Every name pinned here is read back through
OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
