"""Tests for Stage 22 R22-B: recursive aryl-on-heavy-element substituent naming.

Pre-fix: ``c1cc[c]([PbH2][c]2ccccc2)cc1`` (audit row — diphenylplumbane)
emitted ``{[NAMING ERROR: No valid naming plan found for [PbH3][c]1ccccc1]}benzene``.
The carved substituent was ``[PbH3][c]1ccccc1`` (Pb with FV, aryl group
attached) and the plan search had no recipe for naming a Pb/Bi/Sb-rooted
substituent fragment because the heteroatom_center parent allowlist only
covered ``P, Si, B, As, Ge, Sn``.  The analogous Si/Sn/Ge/As cases worked
already because those elements were registered as heteroatom_center parents.

R22-B extends the heteroatom_center parent allowlist with ``Bi, Sb, Pb``
(matching the parent-hydride name table at engine.py: ``bismuthane``,
``stibane``, ``plumbane``), gated on ``ring_systems`` being present in the
interpretation.  The ring-presence gate preserves R18-A test guards:

- ``C[BiH2]`` (no ring) → carbon chain wins → ``1-(bismuthanyl)methane``
  (R18-A form), NOT ``methylbismuthane``.
- ``[BiH2][BiH2]`` (no ring) → heteroatom_chain wins → ``dibismuthane``,
  NOT ``(bismuthanyl)bismuthane``.
- ``[PbH3]c1ccccc1`` (with ring) → ring beats heteroatom_center → still
  ``(plumbyl)benzene`` (R21-A form).
- Carved ``[PbH3][c]1ccccc1`` substituent (FV at Pb, ring present) →
  Pb heteroatom_center fires → ``phenylplumbanyl`` substituent text.

Closes the diphenyl-Pb/Bi/Sb audit-row family.  Each emitted name
round-trips through OPSIN to the original canonical SMILES.

# "RING BEATS HETEROATOM_CENTER" WAS THE WRONG RULE, and these three tests
# were guarding it. R22-B's docstring above states it as design intent; it
# inverts the Blue Book cascade.
#
# BlueBookV2.pdf p. 375, P-44.1.2: "The senior parent structure, whether
# cyclic or acyclic, has the senior atom in accordance with the seniority of
# classes ... N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In >
# Tl > O > S > Se > Te > C. This criterion is applied to select the senior
# atom in parents and TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RINGS AND CHAINS."
#
# Carbon is last. The senior ATOM is decided at P-44.1.2, BEFORE any
# ring-specific criterion (P-44.1.3), and the ring-over-chain rule at
# P-44.1.2.2 applies only "when a ring and a chain contain the same senior
# element" -- which a phenyl-plumbane does not. So Pb, Bi and Sb take the
# parent and the names are the standard ones. Each still round-trips, which
# is why the old form survived: a round trip cannot see preference.
#
# What these tests are really for -- that a Pb/Bi/Sb-rooted fragment can be
# named AT ALL, where it used to emit "{[NAMING ERROR: ...]}benzene" -- is
# unaffected, and is what the assertions check for explicitly now.
