"""P-44.4.1.1: the principal chain has the greater number of multiple bonds.

BlueBookV2.pdf p. 401: "The senior ring, ring system or principal chain has the greater number of multiple bonds". It comes after the chain LENGTH
(P-44.3) and before everything that only tells two numberings or two substituent sets apart.

`strategy._parent_selection_score` used to count unsaturation INFIXES, and one infix names every bond of its kind: `1,3,13-triene` is one infix and three bonds.
A diene and a triene therefore tied on that band, the next tier that sees them (`unsaturation_locants`) is only meaningful between numberings of ONE parent and
ranks the SHORTER locant set higher across parents, and the diene with an ethenyl substituent won on every spelling: the book's P-45.2.3 examples 6 and 9 (pinned in
`test_namer_parent_citation_locants.py`), and any molecule of the same shape. Counting the bonds the infixes name is the whole change.

What is pinned here is the converse as much as the case: a parent with more bonds must win only AMONG chains of equal length (a longer chain with fewer bonds is still the
parent), and the two neighbouring criteria this one must not be mistaken for (double over triple, P-44.4.1.2, is NOT implemented and is pinned as open).
