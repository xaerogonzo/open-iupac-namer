"""The rest of "R before S": which prefix is cited first, which parent a meso compound is named on, and the ester route.

`test_namer_stereo_locant_tie.py` settled the NUMBERING (P-14.4 (j)). Three more places chose by atom order, each found by naming the
Blue Book's own examples and the stereoisomers of a handful of skeletons over random spellings of each:

* **The order two prefixes are cited in** when they read alike but for their descriptors (P-45.6.3, BlueBookV2.pdf p. 427: "R precedes
  S"). `derive_sort_name` sets the descriptors aside, so the sort was stable on the order the tree held them in, and the R,S
  compound was `1-[(2R)-...]-3-[(2S)-...]benzene` or `3-[(2S)-...]-1-[(2R)-...]benzene` by spelling. Z precedes E the same way; the
  rank is the one (j) uses, so the order of citation and the numbering criterion that reads "the prefix cited first" cannot disagree.
  The E/Z case was worse: (g) broke the tie on name TEXT, and "E" sorts before "Z", so E took the lower locant.
* **Which half is the parent** of a meso diether or diamide (P-45.6.2, p. 426): the two halves are equal, either can be the parent,
  and the two names differ only in their descriptors: "the configurational symbols are compared and 'R' precedes 'S'". When the
  parent itself carries two R/S descriptors, P-44.4.1.12.2 (p. 413) comes first: like (RR, SS) before unlike (RS, SR).
* **The ester route** (`_break_ester_tie`): the R-first tier that was built and taken out of the P-14.4 (j) change, because it named
  a meso diester as the R,R compound. The cause was not the tier. The session cache was keyed on a SMILES that cannot write the
  descriptor a carved fragment inherits (`context_stereo_key`), so the second ester plan reused the first plan's tree and its
  descriptors. With that fixed the tier is safe, and `test_every_stereoisomer_of_these_diesters_reads_back` in the other file, which is
  what found it, covers it too.

Every name pinned here was also read back through OPSIN to the structure it came from, and every structure is checked per spelling by
InChIKey (an enumerated molecule written with `doRandom=True` can be a different stereoisomer; see `_spellings` there).
