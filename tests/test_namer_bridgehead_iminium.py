"""Naming round 37 (D-210): a fused ring system with a bridgehead N+ in a double bond is named, instead of a NAMING ERROR.

Quinolizinium (`c1cc[n+]2ccccc2c1`), a tetrahydroquinolizinium, an indolizinium, and the bicyclic amidiniums written with the charge on the bridgehead (`C1C[N+]2=C(CCCCC2)NC1`, the
protonated DBU skeleton drawn the other way) had no name: `fusion_general` describes a ring on a NEUTRAL copy, and a bridgehead N+ with three ring bonds and a double bond has no neutral
copy with the same bonds (valence 4). 190 of 288 such bicycles were a visible `[NAMING ERROR ...]`. Two copies are made now: a twin for the fusion namer (the N+=C bond made single, the carbon
given its hydrogen: `4H-quinolizine`), and a CARBON ANALOGUE for the hydrogen planner, because the bridgehead N+ is a pi atom of the cation as the carbon of the isoelectronic carbocycle is
(quinolizinium plans as naphthalene). The `-ium` is added at the nitrogen's own locant, as for every ring cation.

Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
