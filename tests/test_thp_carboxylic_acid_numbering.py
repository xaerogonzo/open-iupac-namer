"""Regression tests for Stage 22 R22-A — partial-saturation hydro-locant
renumbering for substituted heterocyclic retained rings.

Background:
The curated entry for ``C1=CCNCC1`` (1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) hard-codes
the unsubstituted form's hydro-prefix at 1,2,3,6.  When the engine carved a
substituent off the ring and matched the canonical key, only one substruct
orientation came back from RDKit (the bond-order constraint pinned the C=C
direction), forcing the principal characteristic group onto whichever locant
fell out of that single orientation.  Result for guvacine
(``N1CC(C(=O)O)=CCC1``):

    expected: 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (COOH on sp2 C
              at locant 3, hydro-prefix labels the 4 sp3 atoms 1,2,5,6)
    emitted:  1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid (COOH at locant 3
              but the curated hydro-prefix marks locant 3 as sp3 — OPSIN
              parses this back to the C-saturated isomer ``O=C(O)C1C=CCNC1``,
              breaking round-trip)

The fix in ``iupac_namer/ring_naming/retained_lookup.py``:
    1. Drop the heteroatom restriction in ``_try_derive_hydro_retained``;
    2. Add ``return_all_orientations=True`` mode that emits every
       valid substruct match orientation, each with its own rewritten
       hydro-prefix and Numbering;
    3. When the curated entry is a partial-saturation form (name matches
       ``^[\\d,]+-(?:di|tri|tetra|...)hydro``) AND the underlying aromatic
       parent admits >=2 valid match orientations (true symmetry-based
       ambiguity, e.g. pyridine's C2v), append every derived orientation as
       a separate NamedParent so the strategy layer can pick the one
       minimizing principal-characteristic-group locants
       (P-31.1.4.3.4).

The asymmetric-parent guard (>=2 orientations required) prevents the fix
from disturbing entries like ``2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran`` (coumaran) where
the underlying benzofuran has no ring symmetry — those keep their curated
form unchanged.
