"""The nesting order of enclosing marks, and the fact that it CYCLES.

P-16.5.4 (BlueBookV2.pdf p. 134), verbatim: "When multiple types of enclosing
marks are required, the nesting order is as follows: {[({[( )]})]}". Reading
that from the inside out gives ( ) then [ ] then { } then ( ) again, and so on
-- there is no deepest level.

`_choose_brackets` used to return braces for anything that already contained
braces, with the comment "already at the deepest level IUPAC defines". That
produced `{...{...}...}`, which P-16.5.4.1.5 addresses directly: when the
order "results in consecutive enclosing marks of the same level, the next
level of enclosing mark is used". Measured 2026-09-17, 8 of the 227 benchmark
names were affected.

**THE BLUE BOOK SHIPS ITS OWN TEST VECTOR FOR THIS**, as Fig. 1.3 -- a
six-step chain built up one enclosure at a time, ending in the exact case
that was wrong. Using it beats inventing examples, and step (e) is the one
that proves the cycle rather than a monotonic order.

Two exemptions matter as much as the order itself, because getting them wrong
pushes a simple prefix straight to braces:

  P-16.5.4.1.1  the parentheses of added indicated hydrogen are ignored
  P-16.5.4.1.2  square brackets that are part of a parent structure are
                ignored -- ring fusion, spiro fusion, ring assembly and von
                Baeyer names

A NOTE ON GETTING THIS WRONG TWICE. Two ad-hoc conformance checkers written
while fixing this were both subtly wrong, in opposite directions: one asked
for a monotonically increasing level (which flags the correct `(` around a
`{`), the other compared each mark with its ENCLOSING mark (which flags an
`(oxo)` several levels deep, enclosing nothing and therefore correctly a
parenthesis). The rule is about how deep a mark's CONTENTS nest, not about
what surrounds it. Both versions would have sent someone off to "fix" names
that were already right, which is why what is pinned here is the book's own
examples rather than a checker's output.
