Stage 8 regression tests for retained terpene-ring names.

ARCHITECTURAL DECISION (Stage 8 vocabulary expansion):
======================================================

The audit refresh listed several retained terpene bicyclic names as
candidates for inclusion in ``data_loader._RING_CURATED_SMILES``.  An
OPSIN round-trip probe of each candidate confirmed which names parse
to a stable canonical SMILES:

    camphor       OK   CC12CCC(CC1=O)C2(C)C
    bornane       OK   CC12CCC(CC1)C2(C)C
    borneol       OK   CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
    isoborneol    NOT RECOGNISED by OPSIN
    fenchone      NOT RECOGNISED by OPSIN
    pinane        OK   CC1CCC2CC1C2(C)C
    alpha-pinene  OK   CC1=CCC2CC1C2(C)C
    beta-pinene   OK   C=C1CCC2CC1C2(C)C
    norbornane    OK   C1CC2CCC1C2
    norbornene    OK   C1=CC2CCC1C2
    p-menthane    OK   CC1CCC(C(C)C)CC1
    carane        OK   CC1CCC2C(C1)C2(C)C

Of these, **only camphor is the IUPAC preferred name (PIN) for its
structure** under the 2013 Blue Book retained-name framework.  The
remainder are explicitly NOT PINs:

    Blue Book P1.html line 155:
        bornane / bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (PIN)
    Blue Book Papp3.html lines 120, 153, 158:
        bornane    "(named systematically by CAS)"
        p-menthane "(named systematically by CAS)"
        pinane     "(named systematically by CAS)"

Adding ``bornane`` etc. to ``_RING_CURATED_SMILES`` would override
the correct PIN ``1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane`` with a
non-preferred trivial name — a clear violation of "architecture over
score" (project CLAUDE.md).  These names are therefore DEFERRED.

Camphor is a different case: it is retained under Chapter P-66.6.3
and Table 28.1 (with "(+)-" / "(-)-" stereo descriptor for the chiral
isomers) and is already curated in
``data/retained_names_expanded.json``.  This test pins the existing
behaviour as a regression guard.

The audit's primary stereo probe ``C[C@@]12C(C[C@@H](CC1)C2(C)C)=O``
must continue to emit the *systematic* name even with camphor curated:
the strategy stereo-drop guard
(``strategy._RETAINED_NAMES_ENCODING_STEREO``) does not list camphor,
and ``camphor`` cannot encode stereo.  An attempt to add camphor to
the stereo-encoding set is OUT OF SCOPE for this stage (that file is
owned by another agent in the parallel-dispatch protocol).

    #
    #   * P-66.6.3 is "Chalcogen analogues of aldehydes". It has nothing to
    #     do with ketones, let alone with retaining `camphor`.
    #   * `camphor` appears on exactly two pages of the whole book, 641 and
    #     1000, so it is not in Table 28.1 either.
    #   * p. 641 uses it only as an alias: "1,8,8-trimethyl-3-oxabicyclo
    #     [3.2.1]octane-2,4-dione (PIN) (also known as camphoric anhydride)".
    #   * p. 1000, in P-101 (natural products, i.e. semisystematic rather
    #     than preferred nomenclature), prints three names for this very
    #     structure: "(1R,4R)-bornan-2-one / (+)-camphor /
    #     (1R,4R)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one".
