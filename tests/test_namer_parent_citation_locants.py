"""P-45.2.3: of two parent structures that tie on everything else, the one whose prefixes have the lower locants IN THEIR ORDER OF CITATION.

BlueBookV2.pdf p. 419: "The preferred IUPAC name is based on the senior parent structure that has the lower locant or set of locants
for substituents cited as prefixes to the parent structure (other than 'hydro/dehydro' prefixes) in their order of citation in the name."
It is the criterion after P-45.2.1 (the number of prefixes) and P-45.2.2 (their locant SET), and both of those are tiers of the preference
key, so two plans that tie on the key have the same set and only the ORDER is left: `3-chloro-7-[(4-chloro-3-nitroquinolin-7-yl)sulfanyl]-4-
nitroquinoline` reads `3,7,4` and the other way round of the same molecule reads `4,7,3`.

The book prints FIFTEEN examples, five to a page on pp. 420-422, and every one is a FLAT structure, so the rule reaches achiral molecules,
which is why it is a change of its own: P-14.4 (g) compares two numberings of ONE parent (`_break_alphanumerical_tie`) and the stereo
tie-break only ran for a molecule that carried stereo. Here two PARENTS are compared, and the molecule is the same with either as the parent.
Before the rule the choice was plan order, which follows the order the SMILES atoms were written in: over 13 spellings each the book's name
came out 7, 4, 5, 8 and 10 of 13 (examples 1 to 5), 8, 7 and 8 (examples 7, 8, 10), and 8 and 6 (examples 14, 15), the other name, the one
the book says is NOT preferred, the rest. Both names of each pair are read back through OPSIN below and are the same molecule, so nothing
failed and no corpus row could see it; the name was not a function of the molecule.

Where the fifteen stand, each measured on 13 spellings (`CHANGELOG.md`, 2026-10-06, has the table; the counts before are from the tree before D-191 and D-192):

* **Decided by this rule (twelve):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15. Both names appeared before; the book's is the only one now. (11 and 12 only since D-191 and
  D-192, xaerogonzo/OpenChem-Studio#238, made the engine name a `[PH4]` group with its lambda number and a labelled bromine with its label.)
* **13** compares two numberings of one chain (`5,8,3,6` against `6,3,8,5`), the choice P-14.4 (g) makes: it was the book's name on every
  spelling before the rule too, so it cannot show the split.
* **6 and 9** are decided by a criterion that comes BEFORE this one and is not implemented: P-44.4.1.1 (p. 401), "the senior ... principal
  chain has the greater number of multiple bonds". `strategy._parent_selection_score` counts unsaturation INFIXES, so a `1,3-diene` and a
  `1,3,13-triene` count one each and tie, and then the `unsaturation_locants` tier, which is only meaningful between numberings of one
  parent, ranks the shorter set higher: the engine names those two molecules with an ethenyl substituent on a diene, on every spelling.
  Measured below, pinned as an open defect (a strict xfail, so fixing it fails the suite and this file gets updated), and the rule is
  shown to decide both examples once the bonds are counted (a stand-in for that fix, not the fix).

Three examples of P-45.5, the rule after P-45.3 (nonstandard bonding numbers) and P-45.4 (isotopes), are pinned as the next rule in line:
they tie on this one by the book's own words and are still two names over the spellings.

What is pinned: the book's names exactly, over 16 spellings of each structure (every spelling checked to BE that structure by InChIKey);
that the same spellings split without the rule; that the other name is the same molecule; and the comparison itself on made-up trees, where
each case is one that a plausible mutation of the rule gets wrong (the order of the comparison, a grouped instead of a flat reading, the
letter locants, the guard that the parents are the same).
