"""Regression tests for heteroaromatic-fused ring lactones (P-25.3).

Background:
Benzene-fused ring lactones already named correctly via the curated
``1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran`` (phthalide base) entry + the exocyclic-oxo
``-one`` suffix path.  Heteroaromatic-base-fused furanones / thiophenones
(furo/thieno[3,4-x]azine ring lactones, e.g. pyridoxolactone) had no curated
base scaffold, so the engine failed with "No valid naming plan".

This adds the saturated furan/thiophene-ring base scaffolds for the azine
fusions that OPSIN names as a clean ring lactone:

    * 1,3-dihydrofuro[3,4-c]pyridine    / thieno  (lactone carbons at 1,3)
    * 5,7-dihydrofuro[3,4-d]pyrimidine  / thieno  (lactone carbons at 5,7)
    * 5,7-dihydrofuro[3,4-b]pyrazine    / thieno  (lactone carbons at 5,7)

atom_locants were derived by OPSIN chloro/methyl-probing every substitutable
ring position with a bond-generic SubstructMatch onto the canonical ring
SMILES, with ring heteroatoms and the two bridgehead carbons closed by the
canonical fused-ring perimeter walk (the unique assignment consistent with
all OPSIN anchors).  The engine names the lactone by carving the saturated
base scaffold and expressing the ring C=O as a ``-one`` suffix — the same
machinery that names phthalide as 1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-one.

Each tuple in ``_PROBES`` pins (input_smiles, expected_engine_name) and is
round-tripped through OPSIN to confirm canonical-SMILES equivalence.
