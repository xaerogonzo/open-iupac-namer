"""Naming round 35 (D-208): a ring cation on a curated fused parent keeps its -ium.

A curated retained ring (`data_loader._RING_CURATED_SMILES`) lists `atom_locants` for the positions a substituent can take, and six of them left out the ring heteroatoms
and fusion atoms. The engine adds the `-ium` at the locant of the charged ring atom and, finding none, SKIPPED the atom: the cation of `Cc1[nH+]c2c(s1)CCCC2` was named
`2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,3-benzothiazole`, the neutral compound, which OPSIN reads as another molecule. 528 of 700 cations of the six parents were wrong and 44 more
unreadable. The six tables now give every ring atom its locant, and a plan whose cationic ring atom has no locant fails (the next plan is tried) instead of dropping the charge.

Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
