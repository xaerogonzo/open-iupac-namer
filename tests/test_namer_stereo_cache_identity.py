"""Two substituents that print as the same SMILES are not the same substituent: the session cache's identity.

`CC[C@@H](C)c1cccc([C@@H](C)CC)c1` (the R,S di-sec-butylbenzene) was named `1,3-bis[(2R)-butan-2-yl]benzene` or
`1,3-bis[(2S)-butan-2-yl]benzene`, by the order its atoms were written in. OPSIN reads the first as the R,R compound and
the second as the S,S, so both were names for a different stereoisomer, and the name the Blue Book prints for it (P-14.4
(j), pdf p. 79) is `1-[(2R)-butan-2-yl]-3-[(2S)-butan-2-yl]benzene (PIN)`.

THE CAUSE WAS NOT THE PREFIX MERGER, which is where it first looked to be. Both prefixes reach `merge_identical_prefixes`
already named `(2R)-butan-2-yl`; it correctly merges two identical strings. They were identical because the naming
session's cache is keyed on the fragment's SMILES, and a carved fragment's stereo is not in its SMILES. Cut at either ring
bond, the two substituents are both `CCCC` with the attachment on atom 3: once the ring side is an H the centre is no longer
a stereocentre, so the inherited descriptor (`R`, `S`) lives only in an atom PROPERTY, which `MolToSmiles` cannot write. The
second lookup returned the first fragment's tree. Measured by disabling the lookup: the right name comes out.

What the tests pin, and why each is a separate test:

* the failing case, and its CONVERSE (R,R and S,S still merge into `bis[...]`), because "stop merging" would also pass the first;
* the premise (the two fragments print identically and the key tells them apart) and the WIRING (the session really holds
  one entry per distinct stamp), because a helper that is right but not used passes every other test;
* a miniature of the sweep that found the extent of the defect: every stereoisomer of seven substituent families on a
  1,3-phenylene, read back through OPSIN. Measured before the fix, over nine families and five parents: 56 of 2725 names read
  back as another stereoisomer, in exactly these seven families and all of them a same-family pair on a ring.

THE CITATION ORDER OF THE TWO PREFIXES IS PINNED ELSEWHERE. This file asserts what must hold in every spelling: the two
descriptors are both present and the name reads back to the structure. Which prefix is cited first when the two differ only
in their descriptors is P-45.6.3 (R precedes S, pdf p. 427), pinned by `test_namer_stereo_parents_and_citation.py`; when two
prefixes tie on their letters alone it is P-14.5.4 (the lowest locants at the first point of difference, pdf p. 82), which the
engine does not implement: the book's own `1-(pentan-2-yl)-4-(pentan-3-yl)benzene` comes out in the other order in 20 of 40
spellings.
