"""Severity-A regression suite for the vendored IUPAC engine.

SEVERITY A MEANS THE ENGINE NAMED THE WRONG MOLECULE. Not a debatable
choice between two valid names -- a name that denotes something else.
The benzyl cation came out as `methylbenzene`, which is toluene; the
phthaloyl dication as `1,2-bis(oxomethyl)benzene`, which is
phthalaldehyde. Both were emitted with complete confidence and nothing in
the output to suggest a problem.

Everything here is a single `name_smiles` call, so the whole file costs
a second or two and needs nothing but RDKit.

Each expected name below was verified through the engine's own
correctness criterion -- parse it back with OPSIN and confirm it yields
the input structure, checked on canonical SMILES AND full InChIKey. That
verification needs a JRE, so it lives in test_known_defects.py alongside;
what is pinned here is the resulting string.

`former` records what the engine used to emit. It is not decoration: when
one of these regresses, the failure message shows the wrong answer it
regressed to, which is usually enough to identify the cause without
bisecting.

OPEN defects are marked xfail(strict=True). If one starts passing the
test FAILS, which is the intended alarm -- it means somebody fixed it and
this file needs updating rather than silently drifting out of date.

# Measured, reproduced, not yet fixed. Every one of these currently names
# the WRONG MOLECULE. The common shape is a charged carbon next to
# unsaturation or aromaticity, which no classifier claims, so the charge
# is dropped and the neutral skeleton is named.
# Empty, and that is the point of keeping it: a defect found later is added
# here as xfail(strict=True) so that fixing it FAILS the suite and forces
# this table and KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md to be updated together.
#
# NB "benzylium" would be the obvious target for a benzyl cation and is
# WRONG: OPSIN reads it as O=[C+]c1ccccc1, the BENZOYL cation. Every target
# added here must be checked by parsing it back
# (tests/test_known_defects.py), precisely to catch that
# class of mistake before it becomes someone's goal.

#   [C-]1C=CC=C1  ->  "cyclopenta-2,4-dien-1-ide"
#       The cyclopentadienyl RADICAL anion (no H, one unpaired electron),
#       which is a different species from cyclopentadienide -- different
#       InChIKey -- and the radical is dropped. "cyclopentadienide" was
#       tried as the target and rejected by the OPSIN check in
#       tests/test_known_defects.py: it denotes the
#       closed-shell anion. No name for the radical anion was found that
#       OPSIN parses back to it, so stating one would be guessing.
