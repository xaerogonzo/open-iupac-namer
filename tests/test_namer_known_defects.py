"""Severity-A regression suite for the vendored IUPAC engine.

SEVERITY A MEANS THE ENGINE NAMED THE WRONG MOLECULE. Not a debatable
choice between two valid names -- a name that denotes something else.
The benzyl cation came out as `methylbenzene`, which is toluene; the
phthaloyl dication as `1,2-bis(oxomethyl)benzene`, which is
phthalaldehyde. Both were emitted with complete confidence and nothing in
the output to suggest a problem.

Everything here is a single `name_smiles` call, so the whole file costs
a second or two and needs nothing but RDKit.

Each expected name below was verified through the engine's own
correctness criterion -- parse it back with OPSIN and confirm it yields
the input structure, checked on canonical SMILES AND full InChIKey. That
verification needs a JRE, so it lives in test_known_defects.py alongside;
what is pinned here is the resulting string.

`former` records what the engine used to emit. It is not decoration: when
one of these regresses, the failure message shows the wrong answer it
regressed to, which is usually enough to identify the cause without
bisecting.

OPEN defects are marked xfail(strict=True). If one starts passing the
test FAILS, which is the intended alarm -- it means somebody fixed it and
this file needs updating rather than silently drifting out of date.
