"""Naming round 36 (D-209): a ring cation with an exocyclic C=C on a ring carbon keeps its hydro prefixes.

`C=C1CCC[NH+]=C1` was `5-methylideneazinan-1-ium`, the SATURATED piperidinium: a different molecule. `retained_lookup._try_derive_hydro_retained` finds the hydro positions of a
partly saturated ring of a retained parent, and it counted a ring carbon holding an exocyclic double bond as an sp2 ring member (as it must for the ring's own double bonds). The
ylidene carbon is a hydro position, as in the neutral `3-methylidene-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine`; counted as sp2 it left an odd number of positions and the derivation gave up,
so the cation fell to the saturated ring. The neutral ring never showed it: a curated `3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine` entry matches it with the ylidene as a substituent.

Every name pinned here is read back through OPSIN to its input on canonical SMILES and InChIKey.
