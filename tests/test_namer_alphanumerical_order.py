"""P-45.5: of two parents that tie on everything before it, the name that is earlier in alphanumerical order ("bromo" before "dibromo").

BlueBookV2.pdf p. 424: "The preferred IUPAC name is the name that is earlier in alphanumerical order (see P-14.5). Alphabetic letters are considered first
in the order that they appear in the name; all Roman letters are considered before any italic letters, unless the latter are used as locants ...
Then, if still there is a choice, numerical locants are considered in the order of their appearance in the name."

It is the rule after P-45.2.3 (the lower locants in their order of citation), so its examples are exactly the ones that tie there: "in both names the locant
set is '1,2,4' and the locants appear in the name in the same order ... but 'bromo' in the PIN is earlier alphabetically than 'dibromo'". They were two names
over the spellings of each structure, chosen by the order the SMILES atoms were written in, and every pair read back to the same molecule, so nothing failed.

The book prints five examples. Three are decided here (1, 2 and 4). Example 3 is a cyclophane (`...tribenzenaheptaphane`) the engine does not name. Example 5
carries nuclides, and P-45.4 (isotopes) comes BEFORE this rule and is not applied across parents, so this rule declines a name that carries a bonding number or a
nuclide rather than decide it by the wrong criterion: example 5 stays two names, as it was, pinned as open below.
