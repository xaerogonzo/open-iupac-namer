"""The ring table's atom -> locant maps, held to what a map has to be.

Naming round 4 found eleven entries whose map was stored INVERTED (locant ->
atom: "4: 0", "5: 1"), so one ring atom had no locant and the others were
misplaced; for 2,3-dihydrofuran and 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrole the engine then
named a different molecule ("3-fluoro-2,3-dihydrofuran" for the 4-fluoro
compound). Nothing checked a map's SHAPE, which is what inversion breaks.

The second half checks `fusion_locants.derive_fusion_locants`, which fills
the fusion carbons an entry leaves out, against the entries that already
give them.
