"""Naming round 26: the esters of ONE polyol with ONE acid take the book's functional-class multiplicative name (P-65.6.3.3.3.1).

``CC(=O)OCCOC(C)=O`` is ``ethane-1,2-diyl diacetate (PIN)``, ``propane-1,3-diyl bis(chloroacetate)``, ``propane-1,2,3-triyl triacetate`` (pdf
p. 624). Until round 26 the engine wrote the acyloxy form (``2-(acetyloxy)ethyl acetate``), which the book calls acceptable in general
nomenclature only (P-65.6.3.3.3.2 method 2).

Building it needed the polyvalent organyl group named properly, and four things were wrong on that path (none had been reached before):

* ``render_free_valence_suffix`` prepended a multiplier to a suffix that already carried one: ``ethan-1,2-didiyl``, ``propan-1,2,3-tritriyl``;
* a retained substituent leaf (``phenyl``, ``cyclohexyl``) was used for a DIVALENT ring, naming a different molecule;
* the free valences were numbered by the FIRST one alone, so catechol came out ``1,6-phenylene`` (P-31.1.4.2.4 ranks them as a set);
* the retained ``methylene`` and ``1,2-/1,3-/1,4-phenylene`` (P-29.6.1) were written ``methane-1,1-diyl`` and ``benzene-1,4-diyl``.

NOT built, with the evidence: P-65.6.3.3.3.2 method (1), different anions on one polyol (``propane-1,2,3-triyl 1,2-diacetate 3-propanoate``).
OPSIN reads none of the forms of it (measured: ``methylene acetate formate``, ``1,4-phenylene acetate dichloroacetate`` and the book's three
other examples are all unparseable), so the oracle cannot confirm them and those molecules stay on the accepted acyloxy name, which it can.
