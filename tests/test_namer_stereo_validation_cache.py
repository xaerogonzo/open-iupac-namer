"""The engine's stereo-validation cache, and the two ways it remembered wrong.

`engine._validate_stereo_via_opsin` asks OPSIN whether a name with R/S
descriptors parses, and strips descriptors until one does. The answer is
cached for the life of the process -- and until naming round 3 it was cached
wrongly twice over:

1. **KEYED ON THE NAME ALONE**, while the answer also depends on
   `strip_modes`. A second caller asking a different question got the first
   caller's answer.
2. **AN INCONCLUSIVE RESULT WAS CACHED.** When nothing parses, the pass cannot
   tell "no stripping rescues this name" from "OPSIN cannot run at all": with
   no JRE on PATH every parse fails exactly as an unparseable name would. So
   one call made without Java stripped the stereodescriptors and REMEMBERED
   it, and every later call in the process returned the stripped name even
   once Java was available. An absent JRE became permanent.

Neither raises. Both look like the namer quietly losing stereochemistry,
which is the failure this codebase has spent the most effort making visible.
These tests use a stand-in for OPSIN so they need no JRE and can say exactly
what OPSIN "answered".
