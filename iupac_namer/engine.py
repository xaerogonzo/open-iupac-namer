# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Canonical-key index for the curated inorganic / ion table (P-65.3 salts)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ``data_loader._INORGANIC_CURATED_SMILES`` is keyed on hand-written SMILES,
# a handful of which are NOT in RDKit canonical form — notably the
# partially-deprotonated oxoacid-anion salt entries
# (``O=P(O)(O)[O-]`` → "dihydrogen phosphate", ``O=C(O)[O-]`` → "hydrogen
# carbonate", ``O=S(=O)(O)[O-]`` → "hydrogen sulfate", and the di-anion
# ``O=P(O)([O-])[O-]`` → "hydrogen phosphate").  Because the table key is not
# canonical, ``_lookup_curated_inorganic`` (which compares against the
# *canonical* input SMILES) silently misses them, and the acid-salt anion
# fragment falls through to plan search → ``[NAMING ERROR ...]`` inside the
# composed salt name.
#
# This module-level index canonicalises every table key ONCE at import so the
# acid-salt anion fragments resolve to their curated names regardless of how
# the key happens to be spelled.  It is built immutably at import time (no
# module-level mutable state) and is consulted as a fallback by
# ``_generate_retained_plans`` only when the primary ``lookup_retained_name``
# misses.  For the curated entries no new names are introduced — every name
# already exists in the curated table; this only repairs the lookup's
# canonical-key matching.  The index is additionally seeded with the two
# systematic chalcogenide dianions below (Se/Te), which the curated table
# does not carry.
#
# Systematic monatomic chalcogenide dianions (P-72.2 / IR-5.3.3 ``-ide``
# element-anion names).  The curated inorganic table covers ``[O-2]`` and
# ``[S-2]``; the heavier chalcogenides ``[Se-2]`` / ``[Te-2]`` follow the
# same systematic element-root + ``-ide`` rule and round-trip through OPSIN in
# binary salts (``dipotassium selenide``, ``magnesium telluride``).  These are
# computed systematic names, not whole-molecule pins.  The standalone
# ``(2-)`` charge marker is stripped in the salt assembler exactly as it is
# for oxide/sulfide.

# Systematic dichalcogenide(2-) dianions and exotic monatomic / pseudohalide
# salt anions (IR-5.3.3 / P-65.3 binary-salt anions).
#
# Dichalcogenide dianions are the X-X-bonded dianions ``[O-][O-]`` /
# ``[S-][S-]`` / ``[Se-][Se-]`` / ``[Te-][Te-]`` — the peroxide-class anion of
# salts such as sodium peroxide.  OPSIN names these compositionally as
# ``dioxide`` / ``disulfide`` / ``diselenide`` / ``ditelluride`` (the ``di``
# here is part of the dichalcogenide anion name, NOT a salt multiplier of the
# cation).  These are structurally distinct from two *separate* monatomic
# ``[X-2]`` oxide/sulfide ions by the presence of the X-X bond, which is what
# the canonical-SMILES key encodes — so the X-X bond presence is what selects
# ``dioxide`` (one O-O bond) vs ``oxide`` (a lone ``[O-2]``), resolving the
# cation-charge-independent ambiguity flagged in wave 15-B.  No standalone
# charge marker is emitted because OPSIN's binary-salt form has none
# (``disodium dioxide``, ``barium disulfide``).
#
# ``[3H-]`` (tritium hydride anion) is the ²H-style isotope-specific retained
# anion ``tritide``, the tritium analogue of ``deuteride`` (sodium tritide).
#
# The fulminate family ``[C-]#[N+][X-]`` (X = O/Se/Te) are the
# ``fulminate`` / ``selenofulminate`` / ``tellurofulminate`` retained
# pseudohalide anions (sodium fulminate etc.).
#
# Every name here was verified to round-trip through OPSIN in a binary salt;
# none is a whole-molecule pin (each is a composable anion fragment name).

    # bond IS double — so this case is the OTHER way:
    #
    # Case B: FV bond from N to parent is double (R-N=parent).  Inside the

    # prefix for this is "<R>imino" (P-66.4.1.1.4):

    #
    # Case A (FV bond single but =C inside fragment, i.e. R-CH=N-parent
    # carved at the N) is NOT triggered here because that puts FV at N with
    # bond_order==1 and the fragment has its own =C internal — that flows
    # through the bond_order==1 branch above (which sees a single double-
    # bonded heavy neighbour and emits "<R>amino" — incorrect).

    # external bond, double internal) needs the "<R>idene-amino" form.

    The unsubstituted parents NC(=O)N / NC(=S)N are already recognised by the

    function handles the substituted derivatives that the generic
    substitutive path would otherwise emit as "...methane-1,1-diamide" or
    "...methanethioamide" (which OPSIN rejects for N-substituted cases).

    Detection: locate a sp2 carbon C with exactly three heavy neighbours —
    one =X (X = chalcogen_atomic_num), two acyclic [NX3] — where the carbon
    and both N atoms are acyclic. All other heavy atoms in the molecule must
    be reachable through one of the two N atoms (i.e. the urea/thiourea is
    the molecular core, not a substituent of something else).

    Naming: carve the substituent components on each N, name them
    recursively, attach an `N` or `N'` heteroatom locant. Lower locant goes
    to the substituent cited first alphabetically (P-14.5.2).

    Returns a LeafTree carrying the assembled name, or None if the molecule
    is not a substituted urea/thiourea.

    """IUPAC P-66.4.1.2.4 retained sulfamide name for substituted
    (R)2N-S(=O)(=O)-N(R)2.

    The unsubstituted parent NS(=O)(=O)N is already recognised by the
    `lookup_retained_name` table and emitted as "sulfamide". This function
    handles the substituted derivatives that the generic substitutive path
    would otherwise fail on (e.g. ZT-1575 H2N-SO2-NH-CH2CH2Ph currently
    errors; ZT-2505 loses an entire N substituent cluster when forced onto a
    sulfonamide parent).

    Detection: locate an acyclic sp3d2-like sulfur with exactly four heavy
    neighbours -- two =O oxo neighbours (each terminal, no other heavy
    neighbour, formal charge 0) and two -N acyclic amino neighbours.

    Naming (mirrors `_name_urea_functional_parent`): carve substituent
    components on each N, name them recursively as substituents, attach N
    or N' heteroatom locants. Lower locant goes to the substituent cited
    first alphabetically (P-14.5.2).

    Returns a LeafTree with the assembled "...sulfamide" name, or None if
    the molecule is not a substituted sulfamide.

    R2-S(=O)(=S)-O-R1 (one R on S as C-anchor, one R on O via ester O,
    one terminal =O, one terminal =S).

    Detection: acyclic neutral S with exactly four heavy neighbours —
    - one terminal =O (double-bonded O, charge 0, no other heavy neighbour),
    - one terminal =S (double-bonded S, charge 0, no other heavy neighbour),
    - one single-bonded acyclic neutral O leading to a single heavy anchor

    All other heavy atoms partition between the two R groups via the
    ester-O or the S-C anchors.

    Naming:
    - R1 is named as a SUBSTITUENT (alkoxy/aryl etc.) — gives "methyl",
      "ethyl", ...
    - R2 is carved with the anchor H-capped, then named as a STANDALONE

    Without this dispatcher COS(C)(=O)=S falls through to the generic

    """IUPAC P-66.6 retained "phosphite" FC ester / mono-ester anion / hydrogen
    mono-ester for trivalent acyclic P:

       (RO)(HO)P[OH]     or  (RO)(HO)P[O-]    (hydrogen mono-ester / anion)
       (RO)([O-])P[O-]   or  (RO)([O-])P[OH]  (mono-ester di-anion-ish — rare)

    The classic phosphite ester is the P(III) trivalent species
    (RO)2-P-OH; the conjugate base (RO)2-P-[O-] is the phosphite anion
    that OPSIN parses from "bis(R) phosphite".

    Detection: locate an acyclic neutral P with exactly THREE heavy
    neighbours, all single-bonded oxygens, where:
      - 0..2 are alkyl/aryl ester oxygens (-O-R, R != H)
      - the remainder is a free oxide arm: terminal -OH (charge 0) or
        terminal [O-] (charge -1)
    For a clean phosphite ester FC name we require >=1 ester arm and
    >=1 free oxide arm so the form maps onto "{R1} {R2} phosphite",
    "{R} hydrogen phosphite" or "{R} phosphite".  The all-OH /
    all-[O-] case (orthophosphorous acid / phosphite trianion) and the
    all-ester case (no free oxide → trialkyl phosphite ``triethyl
    phosphite`` etc., not handled here yet) are deferred.

    Naming:
      - 1 ester + 2 free OH  -> "{R} dihydrogen phosphite"
      - 2 ester + 1 free OH  -> "{R} {R'} hydrogen phosphite"  (mixed)
                              or "di{R} hydrogen phosphite" (symmetric)
      - 2 ester + 1 free [O-] -> "{R} {R'} phosphite" / "di{R} phosphite"
      - 1 ester + 1 [O-] + 1 OH -> mixed form, deferred (None)
    Without this, ``CC(C)COP([O-])OCC(C)C`` falls through to the generic
    substitutive path which emits ``bis(2-methylpropoxy)(oxido)phosphane`` —
    a name OPSIN reverses to a P(V)=O tautomer (different bond multiplicity,
    silent oxidation-state change).

    Detection: locate a bridging acyclic neutral O whose two heavy neighbours
    are both sulfonate sulfurs (S, neutral, acyclic, exactly four heavy
    neighbours: two terminal =O, the bridging O, and one R-anchor of any
    element other than O/S). All other heavy atoms must partition cleanly
    between the two R-substituents reached via each S-anchor.

    Naming (P-66.6 anhydride convention):
    - Each R is carved with H-cap at the S-anchor, named as a STANDALONE
      hydride (e.g. -CH3 -> "methane", -C6H5 -> "benzene"), and concatenated
      with "sulfonic acid" -> "methanesulfonic acid".
    - The two acid names are converted to adjective form via _acid_to_adjective
      (strip " acid"), then emitted alphabetically as
      "{adj1} {adj2} anhydride", or collapsed to "{adj} anhydride" when the
      two halves are identical.

    Returns a LeafTree with the assembled name, or None if the molecule does
    not match a clean dialkyl/diaryl sulfonic anhydride.

#
# The pattern: one bare C, formal charge 0, 0 H, 1–3 halogen single-bond
# neighbours, no other heavy atoms.  lambda<N> = number of bonds on C.
# Halogen substituent prefixes are listed alphabetically; same-halogen

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bare-atom radicals such as ``[CH]`` (methylidyne, RDKit canonical with
# 1 H + 3 radical electrons) are rejected by ``_validate_no_open_valences``
# because every heavy atom carries non-zero radical-electron count and there
# is no curated retained-name match.  IUPAC P-29.2 names the bare-C radical
# as "methylidyne" (bonding number 1, 1 H) and OPSIN parses it back to
# ``[CH]`` when ``-r`` is enabled.  The eval harness does NOT pass ``-r`` so
# these names will be unparseable in eval mode, but the resulting structure
# is a correct IUPAC PIN for the radical and the engine no longer raises.
#
# This dispatcher MUST run BEFORE _validate_no_open_valences.

# Phase 5 — lambda-convention bare-C in chain parent (P-29.2 / P-14.1.2)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When a chain or ring contains a SINGLE bare-C atom with non-standard
# valence (carbene-style: 0 H, 0 charge, 1-3 bonds), IUPAC P-14.1.2 names
# the parent normally and prefixes ``<locant>lambda<N>-`` to indicate the
# atom's bonding number.  Examples (verified against OPSIN with
# ``allow_radicals=True``):
#
#   [C]C       -> 1lambda1-ethane
#   [C]=C      -> 1lambda2-ethene
#   [C]CC      -> 1lambda1-propane
#   [C]CCC     -> 1lambda1-butane
#   [C]C=C     -> 3lambda1-prop-1-ene
#   [C]C#C     -> 3lambda1-prop-1-yne
#   [C]=CC     -> 1lambda2-prop-1-ene
#
# Strategy: temporarily upgrade the bare C to its normal 4-valent form by
# adding implicit Hs, name through the regular pipeline, then locate the
# bare-C atom in the assembled parent's numbering.  Mirror to the lower
# locant when the chain is symmetric (acyclic, no asymmetry-breaking
# features beyond the lambda atom and unsaturation).
#
# Must run BEFORE _validate_no_open_valences because the bare C carries
# radical electrons in RDKit's valence model.

# leaving groups below.  IUPAC names these by functional-class nomenclature as
# "{acyl} {class-word}" — exactly parallel to acid halides ("acetyl chloride").
# Diacyl forms (X-C(=O)-R-C(=O)-X) use the diacyl stem with a multiplied or
# alphabetically-ordered mixed class word, e.g.
#   CC(=O)N=C=S            → "acetyl isothiocyanate"
#   O=C(N=C=S)c1ccccc1     → "benzoyl isothiocyanate"
#   O=C(N=C=S)C(=O)N=C=S   → "oxalyl diisothiocyanate"
#   O=C(N=C=S)CCC(=O)[N+]#[C-] → "butanedioyl isocyanide isothiocyanate"
#
# Without this dispatcher the substitutive plan double-counts the carbonyl
# carbon of one acyl group as a substituent on the other's chain (oxalyl →
# "2-(isothiocyanatocarbonyl)ethanoyl isothiocyanate"), and the mono
# isothiocyanate is mis-rendered as "acetic acid isothiocyanate" because the
# ACYL output form falls back to the acid name for retained stems.  Mirroring
# _name_chalcogen_acid_halide, we build the parent ACID (replace every -X with
# -OH), name it via the substitutive pipeline, convert "...ic acid" /
# "...dioic acid" to the acyl form via _acid_name_to_acyl, and append the
# class word(s).  This makes both carbonyl carbons part of the diacid parent,
# so no carbon is double-counted.
#
# A pseudohalide tail is described by its attachment-atom anchor + the SMARTS
# pattern of the whole tail (anchored at the bond to the carbonyl C) and the

# Substituent-only tautomer-pinned ring data (P-25.3.1.3 / P-31.1.4.2.4).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   When an [nH]-bearing heterocyclic ring is used as a SUBSTITUENT, the
#   indicated-H position is fixed (e.g. 1H-pyrazole's NH is at locant 1)
#   and substituent locants must be numbered consistently.  Without this
#   pinning, the generic systematic numbering layer picks the orientation
#   giving heteroatoms the lowest locant set — which is correct in general
#   but produces the wrong substituent locant when the choice between two
#   symmetry-equivalent heteroatom orientations affects only the substituent
#   position.  Examples (without pinning):
#     - NCCc1ccn[nH]1 → emits "...pyrazol-3-yl" (should be "...pyrazol-5-yl",
#       i.e. C adjacent to N1=NH)
#     - histidine ring c1cnc[nH]1 → "...imidazol-4-yl" (should be "-5-yl")
#     - c1ccc(-c2nn[nH]n2)cc1 (2H-tetrazole tautomer) → emits "1H-tetrazol-5-yl"
#       (should be "2H-tetrazol-5-yl" — distinct tautomer, NH at N2 not N1)
#
# Why a SEPARATE side-table from _RING_CURATED_SMILES:
#   Adding atom_locants to the main curated entries causes the parent-naming
#   path (try_retained_name) to emit pre-computed numbering_options that
#   bypass `_compute_monocyclic_numberings`.  That reduces the strategy's
#   numbering option count and changes the plan-cap exhaustion order,
#   exposing benzene/thiophene as parent candidates that beat imidazole on
#   length-based scoring (P-44.1).  Keeping the substituent-pinning data
#   here in a side-table preserves the existing parent-selection behavior
#   while fixing the substituent-locant tautomer mismatch.
#
# Atom_locants are keyed on the ring_mol atom indices in the canonical
# SMILES key (the [nH] is pinned to N1 per P-25.3.1.3).

    The dispatch is gated: ANION/CATION is requested only when the fragment
    carries a charged atom that the suffix machinery can plausibly transform.
    Specifically, we require either
    (a) a suffix-eligible FG whose anchor or atom set contains a charged atom
        of the matching sign (so its base_form will be looked up in
        SUFFIX_VARIANT_TABLE under the requested OutputForm), OR
    (b) a single-heavy-atom fragment whose lone heavy atom is charged
        (handled by retained-name tables, e.g. [NH4+] -> "azanium",
        [Cl-] -> "chloride").

    When the gate fails we fall back to STANDALONE rather than risk
    misapplying a suffix variant to an unrelated FG (e.g. transforming the
    -ol of a hydroxy-carboxylate to -olate when the actual anion is the
    carboxylate).  This conservative gate is consistent with "architecture
    over score": a clean STANDALONE is preferable to a wrong -ate.

    Architectural reject — charge-imbalanced bare-ionic salt
    (Phase 10 misc fix): if every fragment is a bare single-heavy-atom
    ionic species (e.g. ``[Li+]``, ``[CH3-]``, ``[Cl-]``) and the
    cation:anion stoichiometry yields a non-zero net charge, the input is
    a malformed salt — there is no valid IUPAC name that round-trips
    through OPSIN to the same fragment counts.  Example:
    ``[CH3-].[Li+].[Li+].[Li+]`` (3 Li(+) + 1 CH3(-), net +2): the only
    candidate name is "trilithium methanide" but OPSIN parses that to
    3 Li+ + 3 CH3-.  Reject loudly per "architecture over score" — the
    user must supply a charge-balanced structure.

    """Return synthetic ketone-class :class:`DetectedFG` instances for ring
    carbons bearing an unclaimed terminal ``=O`` / ``=S`` / ``=Se`` / ``=Te``.

    IUPAC P-66.6.3: a doubly-bonded chalcogen on a ring carbon is a
    ketone-class characteristic group and is expressed as the ``-one`` /
    ``-thione`` / … suffix when it is the senior group (combining as
    ``-dione`` etc.).  The perception layer's ketone SMARTS
    (``[#6][CX3](=O)[#6]``) only fires when BOTH flanking ring atoms are
    carbon, so it misses:

      * cyclic lactam / imide / urea carbonyls (one flank is a ring N/O/S),
        e.g. hydantoin ``O=C1NC(=O)CN1`` → ``imidazolidine-2,4-dione``;
      * the second carbonyl of adjacent ring diketones, where deconfliction
        collapses the two overlapping ketone matches into one FG, e.g.
        ``O=C1C=Cc2ccccc2C1=O`` → ``naphthalene-1,2-dione``.

    These otherwise fall through to the Pass 1.5 ``oxo_fallback``, producing
    non-preferred ``oxo``/``dioxo`` prefixes.  Synthesising them as
    ketone-class FGs lets the normal PCG machinery promote them to the
    multiplicative ``-one`` suffix (or demote them to ``oxo`` when a senior
    carbon-supplying acid/ester/amide PCG is present — exactly as a
    perception-detected ring ketone is handled).

    Only NON-AROMATIC RING carbons are considered:

      * acyclic ketones, amides, aldehydes and oxo-acids are already detected
        by perception, and an unclaimed acyclic ``=O`` belongs to a senior
        acid context where ``oxo`` IS preferred (e.g. ``3-oxopropanoic
        acid``);
      * a carbonyl on an AROMATIC (mancude) ring carbon (RDKit marks the
        purinedione / xanthine / guanine carbonyl carbons aromatic) is the
        province of the retained-name / indicated-hydrogen / ``dioxo``-prefix
        machinery (e.g. ``1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7H-purin-7-ide``), which
        already round-trips; synthesising a ketone-class FG there would
        derail retained-name selection.  The genuine ``-one``/``-dione``
        gap cases (ring quinones, lactams, imides, saturated ring ketones)
        all carry their ``=O`` on a non-aromatic ring carbon.
