# Many retained ring names cannot express ring-fusion or ring-junction

# cis-decahydronaphthalene and trans-decahydronaphthalene both map to
# the same retained stem, so emitting the bare word silently drops stereo.
#
# When a stereogenic molecule would take a stereo-opaque retained stem we
# disqualify the retained-shortcut plan at the engine level
# (``_generate_retained_plans``) and in the ring-named-parent enumerator
# (``_name_parent_candidates``).  Full structural naming then takes over
# and (where topologically possible) attaches stereo descriptors via the
# relaxed ``_collect_stereo_descriptors`` guard.
