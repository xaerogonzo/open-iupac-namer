"""Orientation (P-25.3.2.3) and numbering (P-25.3.3) of a fused ring system.

Naming round 5, N3. The numbering of a fused ring system is not a property
of its graph alone: the book first DRAWS the system -- every ring in one of
the permitted shapes, as many rings as possible in a horizontal row, then as
many as possible up and to the right -- and numbers clockwise from the
uppermost-right ring of that drawing. Heteroatom and fusion-atom criteria
only choose among the numberings the preferred drawings allow. Without the
drawing, cyclohepta[b]quinoline's nitrogen would take locant 1; with it, the
nitrogen sits where the book puts it.

**THE DRAWING MODEL.** Every permitted shape (pdf p. 214: three- to eight-
membered rings) has vertical left and right sides, so each side of a ring
faces one of eight compass directions, 0 = E, 1 = NE, 2 = N ... 7 = SE, and a
ring's sides, taken counterclockwise, face the directions of its shape:

    3  (0,3,5) or (1,4,7)        6  (0,1,3,4,5,7)
    4  (0,2,4,6)                 7  (0,1,2,3,4,5,7) or (0,1,3,4,5,6,7)
    5  (0,1,3,4,6) or (0,2,4,5,7)    8  (0,1,...,7)

Two fused rings share a side, which faces opposite ways in each; their
centres differ by a lattice step in that direction (E = (2, 0), NE = (1, 1),
N = (0, 2) ...), exact for hexagons and close enough for the quadrant counts
the criteria need. A drawing is a choice of shape and rotation for every
ring that agrees on every shared side and puts no two rings in one place;
`drawings` enumerates them, and both faces of the paper are tried.

**WHAT IS REFUSED** (`Unsupported`, never a guess): rings larger than eight
(the book's distorted shapes), rings sharing more than one bond (bridged
fused, P-25.4), a system with no planar drawing in these shapes, and interior
atoms whose locant rule the module does not implement.
