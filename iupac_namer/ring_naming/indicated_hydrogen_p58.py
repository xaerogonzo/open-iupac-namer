"""Indicated hydrogen, 'added indicated hydrogen' and hydro prefixes, by P-58.2.

When a ring C=O (or C=S, C=Se, C=Te) of a mancude ring system is expressed
as a suffix, the name has to say where the hydrogen atoms went, and the
2013 recommendations give one procedure for it (P-58.2.2, P-58.2.3). This
module is that procedure, as a pure function of the structure. It knows
nothing about names: it returns which ring atoms carry INDICATED hydrogen,
which carry ADDED indicated hydrogen, and which are HYDRO positions, and the
caller renders them.

The procedure, with the book's own examples as the acceptance set
(`tests/vendor/iupac_namer/test_indicated_hydrogen_p58.py`):

1. The parent needs `h0` indicated hydrogens -- the atoms a maximum set of
   noncumulative double bonds leaves over (1 for indole and purine, 0 for
   pyridine and naphthalene).
2. P-58.2.3.1.1 / .1.2: when there are at least as many indicated hydrogens
   as groups, they go on the carbons that carry the groups
   (`1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-one`, `2H-1-benzopyran-2-one`), any extra at the
   lowest remaining position.
3. P-58.2.3.1.3: when there are fewer, one goes to the lowest position
   consistent with the double bonds, the others to group carbons.
4. P-58.2.2: groups the indicated hydrogens cannot accommodate get ADDED
   indicated hydrogen -- the fewest atoms that leave the rest of the ring
   system a Kekule structure (`pyridin-2(1H)-one`,
   `pyrimidine-4,6(1H,5H)-dione`). "This method is preferred over the use of
   nondetachable hydro prefixes".
5. What saturation is left is expressed by hydro prefixes, in pairs
   (`3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one`, `2,3-dihydronaphthalene-1,4-dione`).

Ties are broken by lowest locants in that order: indicated hydrogen, then
added (rule (4): "indicated hydrogen ... has seniority over 'added indicated
hydrogen' for lower locants"), then hydro.

A suffix or free valence joined by a SINGLE bond (-ol, -amine, -yl) enters
the same procedure only where its ring atom has no hydrogen in the mancude
parent -- a fusion carbon, a ring N -- which is what the book's own examples
separate: "naphthalen-4a(2H)-amine" and "pyridin-1(2H)-yl", against
"1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-amine" and "2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl".
A fully hydrogenated fused parent is re-described too, with its hydro
locants omitted when every position is hydro or indicated (P-14.3.4.5).
A whole-ring substituent the retained route wrote as text goes through
`rewrite_leaf_substituent`.

Returns None whenever the structure is outside what this models (charged or
radical ring atoms, a ring atom that is neither pi-capable nor a divalent
chalcogen, an odd number of hydro positions), so the caller keeps the
engine's own answer rather than receiving a guess.
