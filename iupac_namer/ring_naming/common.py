    """Try to produce a valid Mol from a ring fragment SMILES that may have
    aromatic N atoms without explicit H (because a substituent was stripped).

    When ``MolFragmentToSmiles`` carves off a ring from an N-substituted
    molecule it produces bare aromatic 'n' atoms that RDKit cannot kekulize
    (e.g. 'c1cncn1' for an N-methyl imidazole ring).  This function retries
    by inserting [nH] at each bare-n position until a valid molecule is found.

    Also handles the reverse case: a ring fragment that already contains [nH]
    (from a keto/amino tautomer of an aromatic ring, e.g. cytosine's pyrimidine
    ring) may fail to kekulize because the explicit H makes the ring
    non-aromatic in isolation.  In that case we try stripping each [nH] -> n
    to recover the fully aromatic parent SMILES (e.g. 'c1cnc[nH]c1' → 'c1cncnc1'
    = pyrimidine).

    ``allow_nh_insert`` (default True) controls Strategy 1 (insert [nH] at a
    bare-n position).  Set to False when the caller knows the parent ring has
    no NH on any extracted atom — inserting a phantom NH then would corrupt
    locant lookup against curated tables that key the [nH] position to a
    specific IUPAC locant (e.g. all-N-substituted purines like xanthines).

    #
    # Background: ``MolFragmentToSmiles`` produces ``c1c[c]ccc1`` (with
    # explicit ``[c]`` for the formerly-substituted atom) when the parent
    # SMILES has the substituted ring atom in bracketed form (e.g.
    # ``[BiH2][c]1ccccc1`` — phenylbismuthane).  RDKit canonicalises
    # ``c1c[c]ccc1`` to ``[c]1ccccc1`` (preserving the noImplicit
    # property on the bracketed atom), which doesn't match the curated
    # benzene entry ``c1ccccc1``; the engine then falls through to the
    # systematic ``cyclohexane`` branch, silently dropping aromaticity.
    #
    # Phenylsilane (``[SiH3]c1ccccc1``) doesn't trigger this because
    # RDKit canonicalises the Si-attached aromatic C as ``c`` (no
    # brackets).  Why the heavier elements (Bi/Pb/As) leave the bracket
    # form on the substituted ring C is an RDKit canonicalisation
    # idiosyncrasy.
    #
    # The simplest fix is a string-level rewrite: ``[c]`` → ``c`` and
    # ``[C]`` → ``C`` in the fragment SMILES before parse.  An aromatic
    # C with an unfilled bond (the carved free valence) needs an

    """Decide whether to allow phantom [nH] insertion during fragment normalization.

    [nH] insertion (Strategy 1 of _normalize_nh_fragment) is necessary for
    monocyclic N-heterocycles whose curated table keys carry an [nH]
    (imidazole, pyrazole, tetrazole, etc.) — there is exactly one curated
    canonical and the substruct match against the parent is robust to the
    H position.

    It is HARMFUL for fused multi-N rings whose curated table has multiple
    tautomer keys with different atom_locants mappings (purine: 1H/3H share
    one mapping, 7H/9H share another).  When ALL ring N's are substituted in
    the parent (xanthines, all-N-substituted purines), arbitrarily inserting
    [nH] produces a key whose atom_locants are wrong for the actual
    substitution pattern.  In that case we disable [nH] insertion and let
    Strategy 4 (partial sanitize) produce the bare aromatic skeleton, which
    has its own dedicated curated entry.

    Heuristic: disable only for fused rings with ≥3 ring N's AND no NH on
    any ring atom in the parent.  Benzimidazole (2 N's), benzazoles, and
    indazoles have a single curated tautomer key, so [nH] insertion is safe;
    purines / xanthines (4 N's) have multiple tautomer keys with different
    atom_locants, so phantom NH insertion corrupts locant assignment.

    An aromatic ring [n-] or [n+] counts as an NH for this decision — it
    occupies the same tautomer slot as [nH] (same lone-pair contribution
    to the π system, same IUPAC locant) and the charge is rendered via a
    separate ``-N-ide`` / ``-N-ium`` suffix, not by the curated-key
    tautomer mapping.  Examples: theophyllin-7-ide ([n-] slot), a fused
    ring cation like 3-methylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-3-ium ([n+] slot).
