iupac_namer/ring_naming/retained_lookup.py

Retained ring name matching.

Strategy:
1. Extract the ring system into an isolated molecule.
2. Convert to canonical SMILES.
3. Look up in retained_rings.json and rings_from_opsin.json.
4. Also maintain a hand-curated SMILES->name map for the most common rings
   (benzene, pyridine, naphthalene, etc.) to guarantee correct lookup
   independent of how data files are keyed.

Returns list[NamedParent] (0 or 1 items).

# Non-substitutable retained ring names (P-25.3 / P-31)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A handful of retained ring names accepted by OPSIN as bare scaffolds are NOT
# substitutable in OPSIN's vocabulary: OPSIN refuses to attach a substituent
# locant to the retained stem (it parses "xanthine" but rejects
# "8-chloroxanthine").  Per P-25.3 / P-31, the systematic ring name is the PIN
# and is fully substitutable, so a substituted instance must fall back to the
# systematic parent.  For the xanthine family the systematic parent is the
# mancude purine carrying a 2,6-dione (``3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione``),
# which the oxo-on-mancude derivation (_try_derive_oxo_aromatic_retained, with
# the over-NH partial-sanitize fallback) reconstructs and the downstream
# characteristic-group + indicated-H layer renders.
#
# The bare scaffolds themselves (xanthine, hypoxanthine, caffeine, theobromine,
# theophylline, guanine, adenine) are resolved by the WHOLE-MOLECULE retained
# table in data_loader/retained_names_expanded.json BEFORE the ring-naming path
# is reached, so they keep their retained names; only forms that reach
# ``try_retained_name`` with an unexpressible ring substituent fall back here.
#
# GENERAL GAP: ideally this lives as a ``substitutable: false`` flag on the
# affected entries in data_loader._RING_CURATED_SMILES and on the
# rings_from_opsin data entries, so any non-substitutable retained ring (not
# just xanthine) auto-falls-back.  data_loader.py is outside this change's
# scope; pending that data-side flag, the set below enumerates the
# verified-non-substitutable names this module gates on.

    # name (e.g. ``2,3-dihydrofuran``), but a furanone / thiophenone whose ring
    # carbonyl is NOT the principal characteristic group (a higher-seniority
    # group such as -COOH is present) must renumber so that group gets the
    # lowest locant — which moves the actually-saturated ring atoms to
    # different locants and forces the ring carbonyl to be cited as an ``oxo``
    # PREFIX.  In that decomposition the carbonyl carbon is itself a saturation
    # (added-H) position, so the dihydro locant set must INCLUDE it (e.g.
    # ``2,3-dihydrofuran`` -> ``5-oxo-4,5-dihydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid``, not
    # the structurally-wrong ``5-oxo-2,3-dihydrofuran-...``).
    #
    # Derive these orientations from the fully-mancude parent (furan /
    # thiophene) with the ring carbonyl counted as a saturation position, and
    # offer them as additional candidates.  The strategy layer keeps the
    # curated form for the no-higher-PCG case (where the carbonyl is the
    # suffix) and selects an oxo+dihydro orientation only when it gives the
    # lower principal-group locant.  Gated on the curated entry being a
    # 5-ring dihydro form whose mancude parent we carry oxo-dihydro locants for
    # (so 6-ring pyranones, already handled via the 2H-/4H-pyran partial-
    # saturation parents + plain 5b, are untouched).

    # curated ``match_name``'s set.  When the curated entry is the SYMMETRIC
    # saturation form (e.g. ``2,5-dihydrofuran``, saturation flanking the
    # heteroatom), every re-orientation reproduces the same locant set and the
    # ring carbonyl is correctly handled as the suffix at its lowest locant by
    # the curated path — adding equal-set orientations would only inject a
    # higher-locant oxo numbering (``...-5-one`` instead of ``...-2-one``).

    Procedure (P-31.1.4.3.4 lowest-locant principal characteristic group;
    P-66.6 ketone/thione/imine suffix on a mancude ring):

      1. Locate every ring carbon that bears exactly one exocyclic double bond

      2. Build an aromatized copy of the ring system with those exocyclic

         the result will not sanitize (i.e. the skeleton is not a genuine
         mancude ring).
      3. Require that, IGNORING the oxo carbons, every remaining ring atom is
         already aromatic in the input.  This keeps the derivation tight: a
         ring that also has saturated CH2 positions is a ``dihydro…dione`` case

      5. Build the full-mol Numbering from the curated key's atom_locants via

    """Derive an ``<locants>-<multiplier>hydro-<retained_name>`` name when the
    input ring system is a partly-hydrogenated form of an aromatic retained
    parent.

    Procedure:
        1. Build an "aromatized" copy of ``ring_mol`` — every ring atom is
           flagged aromatic and every ring bond is set to aromatic.
        2. Canonicalize the aromatized form and look it up in ``_CURATED``.
           If absent, bail.
        3. If the matched retained entry carries ``atom_locants`` (required
           for a deterministic locant assignment), build a relaxed-bond
           SMARTS query from the curated key and substructure-match it into
           ``mol`` to map curated-key atom indices to full-mol atom indices.
        4. Collect the sp3 (non-aromatic, with one or more implicit Hs) ring
           atoms in the input ``mol``; these are the hydrogenation positions.
           Translate their full-mol indices to IUPAC locants via the
           atom_locants mapping (picking the match orientation that yields
           the lowest-locant sp3 set).
        5. Build the hydro-prefix and the synthesised name; build a Numbering
           from the chosen match.

    When ``return_all_orientations`` is True, returns a *list* of dicts —
    one per substruct match orientation — instead of just the lowest-sp3
    one.  This lets the caller offer multiple NamedParent candidates so the
    strategy layer can pick the orientation that minimizes principal
    characteristic group locants (P-31.1.4.3.4) rather than always
    minimizing the hydro-prefix locants.

    Returns a dict with keys ``name``, ``substituent_form``, and
    ``numbering_options`` (a tuple of Numbering); a list of such dicts when
    ``return_all_orientations`` is True; or ``None`` when the derivation
    doesn't apply.

    When ``include_oxo_carbons_as_saturation`` is True (the oxo+dihydro
    re-orientation path, P-31.1.4.1.1 / P-31.1.4.3.4), ring carbons bearing
    exactly one exocyclic suffix-eligible double bond (=O / =S / =Se / =Te /
    =NR) are ALSO counted as saturation (added-H) positions.  Lifting that
    double bond off as an ``oxo`` (etc.) prefix turns the carbon into a
    saturated ring member, so it contributes to the dihydro count.  The
    exocyclic =O is left UNCLAIMED (not added to ``extra_atom_indices``) so the
    downstream characteristic-group layer renders it as the ``oxo-`` prefix.
    In this mode the parent atom_locants are sourced from
    ``_OXO_DIHYDRO_MANCUDE_PARENT_LOCANTS`` first (so adding them does not
    perturb the ordinary direct-curated-match numbering), falling back to the
    curated table.  This mode is invoked ONLY from section 5b for curated
    partial-saturation entries, so it cannot affect the count==1 added-IH
    path used by mancude ketones such as ``naphthalen-1(2H)-one``.
