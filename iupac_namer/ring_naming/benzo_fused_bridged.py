iupac_namer/ring_naming/benzo_fused_bridged.py

Specialised naming for benzo-fused bridged-bicyclic ring systems
(e.g., dezocine's 5,11-methanobenzocyclodecene skeleton).

The generic bridged-VB path yields tricyclo[...] names that collapse the
aromatic benzene into a saturated ring — losing aromaticity and therefore
failing OPSIN round-trip.  This module detects the pattern

    benzene (aromatic 6-ring) ortho-fused to one macrocycle that is
    itself bridged by a small methano/ethano bridge

and emits the IUPAC-preferred name

    <hydro-prefix>-<bridge-locs>-methano-benzocyclo[N]ene

with an explicit atom → locant pin that the engine uses for substituent
locant assignment.  The aromatic benzene carbons keep locants 1–4
(with 4a, 12a as fusion), and the aliphatic ring is numbered
5, 6, 7, …, (N+4), with the bridge atoms continuing after.

Scope guard:
    Only activates when the ring system is:
      - classified "bridged" (may be ambiguous with "fused")
      - contains exactly ONE fully-aromatic 6-membered SSSR ring
      - that ring shares exactly 2 bonded atoms with the rest of the system
      - the non-benzene portion + fusion atoms forms a bicyclic whose two
        paths between the bridgeheads enclose the benzene fusion edge

    # on benzene (i.e. locant 4 in the benzene chain).  Actually f_high is
    # adjacent to benzene-locants 1 AND f_low, and to aliphatic locant via
    # being a fusion atom.  Let me re-derive.
    # In benzocyclodecene:
    #   locants 1-2-3-4 are the 4 non-fusion benzene C's in order.
    #   locant 4a is a fusion C, bonded to 4 and to 5 (on aliphatic side).
    #   BUT 5 is adjacent to f_low (not f_high)!
    # So: f_high is bonded to 1 and to (macro_size+2) (= 12 for N=10).
    #     f_low is bonded to 4 and to 5.
    # Hmm, let me re-check from the OPSIN structure above:
    #   5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydrobenzocyclodecene → c1ccc2c(c1)CCCCCCCC2
    #   Numbering: 1-2-3-4-4a-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-12a-1
    #   (ring of 14 atoms)
    # Here 4a is between 4 and 5, 12a is between 12 and 1.  So 4a is adjacent
    # to both 4 and 5 ⇒ 4a = f_low (bonded to aliphatic 5).
    # And 12a is adjacent to both 12 and 1 ⇒ 12a = f_high (bonded to
    # aliphatic 12 and benzene 1).
    # So: f_low was already the one adjacent to aliphatic 5 (locant 5 in
    # macro_walk[1]), and its benzene neighbour with locant 4 is the end of
    # the bz_chain.  f_high is adjacent to bz_chain[0] (locant 1) and to
    # macro_walk[-2] (locant macro_size+2).
    # So we should swap: f_low_atom = 4a = adjacent to 4 and 5.
    #                    f_high_atom = 12a = adjacent to 1 and 12.
    # Our detection above IS consistent: the fusion atom with a neighbour at
    # locant 4 is f_low (gets locant 4a), and at locant 1 is f_high (gets
    # (macro+4)a).

    # Actually our earlier walk assigned:
    #   bz_chain = _walk_benzene(f_high, f_low): 4 atoms from neighbour of
    #              f_high (locant 1) to neighbour of f_low (locant 4).
    # So the benzene atom at locant 1 is adjacent to f_high; locant 4 is
    # adjacent to f_low.  So:
    #   f_low gets compound locant "4a"
    #   f_high gets compound locant "(macro_size+4)a" = e.g. "12a" for N=10
    # But the f_high_atom/f_low_atom we derived: checking neighbour's
    # integer locant == 1 ⇒ that fusion atom is f_high.  == 4 ⇒ f_low.
    # So f_high_atom → compound locant (macro_size+4) with 'a' suffix.
    #    f_low_atom  → compound locant 4 with 'a' suffix.
