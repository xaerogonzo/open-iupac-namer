Von Baeyer polycycle decomposition (IUPAC P-23.2.5, extensions for tricyclic+).

Decomposes a bridged ring system into:

  1. Two main bridgeheads (bh1, bh2).
  2. Three (or two) "main bridges" — disjoint simple paths between bh1/bh2.
     These contribute the first three numbers of the descriptor:
       bicyclo[a.b.c]...                         (2 bridges + trivial 0 third)
       bicyclo[a.b]...                           (degenerate fused-edge case)
       tricyclo[a.b.c.d^{p,q}]...                (main + 1 secondary)
       tetracyclo[a.b.c.d^{p,q}.e^{r,s}]...      (main + 2 secondaries)
       ...
  3. Zero or more "secondary bridges" — each is a simple path between two
     atoms already on the skeleton so far, going through zero or more
     uncovered atoms.  Listed in descending bridge-size order.

The decomposition is chosen by IUPAC selection rules (greatest coverage,
then main ring size, then main bridge size, then descending secondary
bridges, then lowest superscript locants).  This module returns the atomic
topology; locant assignment and name emission live in :mod:`bridged`.
