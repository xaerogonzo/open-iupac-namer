"""Atom ownership on the semantic tree (naming round 5, N2).

**THE INVARIANT.** Every heavy atom of the molecule named at a level is owned
by EXACTLY ONE node of the tree built for that level: the parent hydride, one
suffix group, or one prefix. Checked on the tree the executor is about to
return -- never by parsing the emitted string -- and at every recursion depth,
because every substituent is named by the same executor.

**WHY THE PLAN-LEVEL CHECK WAS NOT ENOUGH.** `SubstitutivePath.execute` has
long had a "no silent atom drop" check, but it asks only whether the UNION of
the plan's claims covers the molecule. Two things escape that:

* a claim that never becomes a tree node. Round 4 measured it twice: an FG
  with no prefix form that was not the principal group was claimed by a
  prefix assignment, produced no `PrefixEntry`, and "pentanoic acid" was
  emitted for an oxime acid; and an Si-OH suffix class claimed the Si, whose
  suffix could not express it, so trimethylsilanol came out "hydroxymethane".
  Both were caught only by an OPSIN round trip, after the fact.
* an atom claimed twice, which a union cannot see at all.

So the tree carries its own provenance: `PrefixEntry.claimed_atoms` is
stamped from the plan assignment that produced the entry
(`ClaimingPrefixList`), and the check reads the tree.

**WHAT A NODE OWNS.**

* parent: `named_parent.candidate.atom_indices`;
* a suffix group: its FG atoms that are neither parent atoms (a
  chain-terminal "-oic acid" carbon is a parent atom; its oxygens are the
  suffix's) nor pattern CONTEXT. A suffix SMARTS matches its neighbours as
  plain ``[#6]`` -- the R of an amine, the N-R of an amide, both R of a
  ketone -- and those atoms belong to whatever names them; first measured,
  every one of the 30 double-owned levels on the tuning corpora was this;
* a prefix: `claimed_atoms`.

Hydrogens are never owned; indicated and added hydrogen are descriptors.

**MODES** (`IUPAC_NAMER_OWNERSHIP`, read per call so a test can switch it):

* ``enforce`` (default): a violating tree is replaced by an `ErrorTree`
  carrying the diagnostic, so the plan loop tries the next plan and no name
  missing an atom is ever emitted -- "unsupported is not success";
* ``strict``: raise `OwnershipError` (the test suite runs this way);
* ``record``: keep the tree, append the diagnostic to `RECORDED` (for
  measuring a corpus before the check is enforced).
