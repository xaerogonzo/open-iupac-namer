"""iupac_namer.diagnostics
====================================================

Opt-in instrumentation for the naming engine.  Off by default, zero cost
when off, and deliberately *not* imported by anything that runs in the
hot path except through :func:`enabled`.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The engine has a failure shape that is worse than an exception: a
perception classifier correctly claims every formal charge in a
molecule, its renderer then fails to compose a surface name, the
dispatcher returns ``None``, and the generic plan search names the
*neutralized* skeleton instead.  The caller gets a confident, wrong
answer -- ``methylbenzene`` for the benzyl cation -- with nothing in the
output to suggest anything went wrong.

Those gaps cannot be found by reading the code, because the code that
produces the wrong answer is working exactly as written.  They have to
be measured: run a corpus, record every point where a renderer declined,
and read off the list.  This module is that recorder.

It is permanent rather than a throwaway script because the next such gap
will surface years from now, and whoever hits it will want the
instrument already in the box.

Usage
-----
Set the environment variable, then name things::

    IUPAC_NAMER_DEBUG=1 python -c "..."

Or scope it programmatically, which is what the sweeps and tests do::

    from iupac_namer import diagnostics

    with diagnostics.capture() as rec:
        name_smiles("[CH2+]c1ccccc1")
    rec.failures      # -> (RenderFailure(suffix_hint='...', ...),)
    rec.stats         # -> {'...': {'attempted': 1, 'succeeded': 0, 'failed': 1}}

``capture()`` is re-entrant-safe in the sense that nested captures share
one recorder; it is *not* safe to use from two threads at once, which is
fine -- naming is synchronous and the engine is single-threaded.

Architectural note
------------------
``perception.charge_perception`` documents "no module-level mutable
state" as an invariant, and that invariant is worth keeping: the
classifier must stay pure given its input mol.  The mutable counters
therefore live *here*, in a module the classifier only touches through a
boolean check, so the purity property of the perception layer is
unchanged whenever diagnostics are off -- which is always, in
production.
