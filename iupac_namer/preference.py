"""How candidate naming plans are ranked: typed keys instead of one blended float.

**WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS.** Plans were ranked by one float that added band
constants from 0.0001 to 1,000,000, and comments policed the collisions
("this band-2 score must stay well below 10 so that the band-3 minimum step
always dominates"). A collision is silent -- the output is simply the
second-best name -- and naming round 4 found one living in the smallest band:
the alphanumerical tie-break (P-14.4 (g)) keyed every carbon substituent as
"z", so `ethyl` and `methyl` tied and plan order produced
`4-ethyl-1-methylbenzene`. A real tier cannot be written inside a ×0.0001 term.

Three things, kept apart:

* `LegacyScoreKey` wraps the old float EXACTLY. It is the mechanical step:
  same value, same ordering, same ties, same winners.
* `NomenclaturePreferenceKey` is a tuple of declared tiers compared
  lexicographically (`TIER_SPECS` says what each tier is, and in which
  direction it is better). No tier can overflow into the one above, and locant
  sets are compared at the FIRST POINT OF DIFFERENCE as P-14.3.5 requires,
  where the float compared SUMS ({1,4} and {2,3} tie on a sum).
* `SearchBound` is the early-stop test. It is a different type from a key,
  so a threshold can never be ranked as though it were a plan.

The alphanumerical criterion is deliberately NOT a tier. It needs the
prefixes' complete names (P-14.5.2), which do not exist until a plan is
executed, so it is applied at selection time, between plans that tie on every
tier here -- see `engine._break_alphanumerical_tie`.
