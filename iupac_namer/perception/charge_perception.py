"""iupac_namer.perception.charge_perception
====================================================

Charge perception + ``-ylium`` / ``-ide`` / acylium / amidinium / diazonium
dispatcher (Stage 6 R2-B, root cause #3 in
``docs/opsin_coverage_taxonomy.md`` and Top-3 Gaps 4/7/13 in
``docs/opsin_audit_fg.md`` / ``docs/opsin_audit_hw_charge.md``).

Why this module exists
----------------------
Historically the engine's neutralizer sanitises away formal charges
*before* functional-group detection runs.  That throws away the very
clue the charge-suffix scorer would need to emit ``methylium`` /
``methanide`` / ``acetylium`` / ``ethanamidinium`` / ``ethane-1-diazonium``
and friends, so the engine ends up naming the neutralized skeleton
(``methane``, ``ethane``, ``1-oxoethane`` …) and the round-trip fails.

This module is a *perception classifier* with a tightly-scoped engine
hook.  It runs on the original (still-charged) RDKit ``Mol`` ahead of
the generic plan search and recognises a handful of well-defined
charge motifs:

* **alkanide / alkanylium** - aliphatic ``[C-]`` / ``[C+]`` carbon
  centres on a saturated chain or ring (e.g. ``[CH3+]`` -> methylium,
  ``[CH2-]CCCC`` -> pentan-1-ide, ``[CH+]1CCCCC1`` -> cyclohexan-1-ylium).
* **alkanediazonium** - acyclic ``[N+]#N`` terminal triplet bound to a
  parent carbon (``CC[N+]#N`` -> ethane-1-diazonium).
* **alkanamidinium** - the protonated-imine amidine cation
  ``R-C(=[NH2+])N`` (``CC(=[NH2+])N`` -> ethanamidinium).
* **acylium / carbonylium** - the carbon-centred acyl cation
  ``R-[C+]=O`` (``[C+](C)=O`` -> acetylium, ``C1(CCCCC1)[C+]=O`` ->
  cyclohexanecarbonylium).
* **boranuide** - ``[BH4-]``, the simplest known boron anion.

For every such motif we emit a ``LeafTree`` whose ``text`` is the
already-composed surface name; downstream assembly treats it as a
terminal string just like a retained-ring lookup.

What this module *does not* claim
---------------------------------
Charge motifs that the engine already names correctly are deliberately
left to the existing machinery:

* ring-embedded ``[N+]`` / ``[n+]`` cations (e.g. pyridinium,
  quinolinium) - handled by the substitutive ring-cation path
  (``ring_cation_locants``);
* ring-embedded aromatic ``[n-]`` anions - handled by the
  substitutive ring-anion path (``ring_anion_locants``);
* retained-name cations like ``pyrylium`` / ``phenylium`` /
  ``chromenylium`` - handled via the retained-ring SMILES table;
* monatomic salts (``[Na+]``, ``[Cl-]``) - handled in the salt path.

When ``classify_charges`` finds zero motifs it claims *nothing* and the
engine falls through to its existing dispatch.  That is the standard
non-regression contract: any compound that rendered correctly before
this module landed must still render correctly after, byte-identical.

Architectural notes
-------------------
* No module-level mutable state (caches, etc.) - all data is
  ``frozen=True`` and the dispatcher is pure-functional given the
  input mol.
* The classifier *never* mutates the input ``mol``; the per-motif
  emitters build fresh RDKit objects via ``Chem.RWMol`` for the
  neutralized parent surrogate that drives recursive naming.
* No silent atom drops: every returned ``ChargeClassification``
  enumerates the atom indices it claims, so a future extension can
  cross-check coverage against the engine's atom-claim ledger.
* Output names go through ``py2opsin`` round-trip in the test suite -
  every probe in the audit CSVs that this module closes is pinned to a
  ``classify_charges`` result and an end-to-end ``name_smiles`` ->
  OPSIN -> canonical-SMILES round-trip.

    ``c1ccc[c-]c1`` -> ``benzen-1-ide``; ``[n-]1cccc1`` -> ``1H-pyrrol-1-ide``.

    The mirror of :func:`_classify_aromatic_ring_cation`, and it exists
    for the same reason: nothing else claims these, and an unclaimed
    charge is not left alone -- the plan search neutralizes it. The
    phenyl anion came out as ``cyclohexane``, losing the charge AND the
    aromaticity, which is about as wrong as a name can be.

    ``_classify_simple_carbon_charge`` deliberately refuses an aromatic
    charged atom, because a ring carbanion needs the ring parent's
    numbering rather than a chain's; that is what this classifier
    supplies. It emits the plain ``"ide"`` hint so the existing
    ``_render_simple_carbon`` composes the name: neutralize the site,
    name the ring parent, and take the locant from the engine's own
    substituent numbering. That works across ring systems --
    ``benzen-1-ide``, ``naphthalen-2-ide``, ``pyridin-3-ide``.

    Detection contract (all must hold, else yields nothing):

    * exactly one formally-charged atom, a carbon or nitrogen with charge -1.
      The nitrogen case is the azolide family (pyrrolide, imidazolide,
      tetrazolide), where the charge sits on the ring N.  Nothing claimed
      those either, and the plan search did something worse than dropping
      the charge -- it MOVED it, naming pyrrolide ``1H-pyrrol-2-ide`` with
      the charge on a ring carbon;
    * it is aromatic and in a ring;
    * NEUTRALIZING THE SITE STILL LEAVES AN AROMATIC RING. This is the
      line between two chemically different species, not a convenience.
      Benzenide is a SIGMA carbanion: a hydrogen was removed from an sp2
      ring carbon and the lone pair sits in the ring plane, leaving the
      aromatic sextet intact -- put the hydrogen back and you have
      benzene, so the parent IS an aromatic ring and the name is that
      parent plus ``-ide``. Cyclopentadienide is a delocalised PI anion
      whose charge belongs to the whole ring; put a hydrogen back and you
      get cyclopenta-1,3-diene, which is not aromatic. It has a retained
      name and belongs to the path that owns it.

      Cheaper-looking tests do not work. ``[cH-]1cccc1`` is closed-shell,
      so a radical test misses it; and "the charged carbon has no
      hydrogen" misses ``Clc1ccc[c-]1Cl``, where the position is occupied
      by a chlorine rather than vacated by a proton -- still a
      delocalised cyclopentadienide, and one that reaches this classifier

    unsaturation — a badly WRONG result.  ``_classify_simple_carbon_charge``

    fall through to plan search untouched.  This classifier claims the ring
    cation as an ``-ylium`` motif (P-73.2.2.1.1 H-removal cation) and the
    renderer composes the ``cyclo<stem>-<ene-locants>-<n>-1-ylium`` PIN by
    fixing the cationic carbon at locant 1 (the ylium suffix outranks the
    ene unsaturation for low locants).

def _classify_aryl_substituted_chromenylium(mol) -> Iterable[ChargeClassification]:
    """Detect ``2-aryl-chromenylium`` (the flavylium family).

    Why this classifier exists
    --------------------------
    The retained-ring lookup happily resolves the bare chromenylium
    SMILES to the name ``chromenylium``, but the engine's PCG (parent
    class group) selector treats a 2-aryl-chromenylium molecule as
    *two* ring systems linked by a single bond (chromenylium + phenyl)
    and picks the neutral phenyl as parent, emitting the structurally
    correct but charge-dropping name ``(chromen-2-yl)benzene``.  The
    [O+] is silently neutralised in the process — a real naming defect.

    This classifier closes that gap by recognising the 2-aryl-
    chromenylium pattern *before* the plan search runs and emitting
    the OPSIN-compatible flavylium-family surface name directly.  No
    guard relaxation: the [o+] is explicitly enumerated in
    ``site_atom_indices`` so coverage gates in ``detect`` see the
    charge claimed.

    Detection contract
    ------------------
    Fires only when *all* of the following hold (otherwise yields nothing):

    * the molecule's only formal-charge atom is a single aromatic
      ``[o+]`` in a 6-membered ring fused to a benzene (i.e. the
      chromenylium core);
    * the chromenylium pos-2 carbon (the aromatic C ortho to ``[o+]``
      that is NOT part of the benzo ring) carries an exocyclic single
      bond to an aromatic carbon that is itself in a *separate*
      6-membered aromatic ring (the 2-aryl substituent);
    * the 2-aryl ring is a benzene (no heteroatoms, no fused partners
      of its own) — so the aryl is either unsubstituted phenyl
      (``flavylium``) or carries a single methyl (``2'-`` / ``3'-`` /
      ``4'-methylflavylium``).  Anything richer is left to the engine
      because OPSIN does not parse arbitrary primed-locant
      chromenylium derivatives unambiguously.
    * the chromenylium core itself (positions 3..8) carries no other
      exocyclic substituents; substituted-core flavylium variants are
      already named correctly by the existing substitutive flow without
      dropping the [O+].

    What this classifier *does not* claim
    -------------------------------------
    * bare chromenylium (no 2-aryl) — already handled by retained-ring
      lookup, byte-identical;
    * 2-methyl / 2-alkyl chromenylium variants — handled by the
      existing substitutive-name machinery that does not drop the
      [O+] for them;
    * 3-/4-substituted chromenyliums *with* a 2-aryl partner — these
      need primed locant + ring-locant combinations that OPSIN does
      not reliably round-trip; we leave them to fall through.

# P-72 / P-73: polycharged / zwitterionic species
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Four structural families closed here, each generalising a P-72/P-73 rule
# rather than pinning a molecule:
#
#  (A) carbanion zwitterion  — a senior ``[C-]`` anion (suffix ``-ide``) that
#      coexists with a cationic onium centre expressed as a substituent
#      prefix (``...ammoniumyl`` / ``...oxoniumyl`` / ``...sulfaniumyl``).
#      P-73/P-74: anions outrank cations for suffix citation, so the carbanion
#      takes the suffix and the cation becomes a detachable prefix.
#      Example: ``C[N+](C)(C)[C-](C)C`` -> ``2-(trimethylammoniumyl)propan-2-ide``.
#
#  (B) substituted single-carbon dianion — one ``[C-2]`` carbon carrying only
#      substituents (no carbon backbone of its own) names as
#      ``<prefixes>methanediide``.
#      Example: ``[C-2](c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1`` -> ``diphenylmethanediide``.
#
#  (C) di-charged 2-atom nitrogen backbone — a diazane (N-N) or diazene (N=N)
#      hydride whose two N atoms (or one N at |q|=2) carry like charges, named
#      ``<prefixes>diazane-1,1-diide`` / ``<prefixes>diazene-1,2-diium``.
#      Examples: ``CC(=O)N[N-2]`` -> ``acetyldiazane-1,1-diide``;
#                ``C[N+](C)=[N+](C)C`` -> ``tetramethyldiazene-1,2-diium``.
#
#  (D) ring polycarbanion — two or more like-charged ring carbanions on a
#      (possibly partially hydrogenated) carbocyclic ring, named
#      ``<parent>-x,y-diide`` where the neutralised parent is whatever the
#      engine names the de-charged ring as.
#      Example: ``[CH-]1C=C[CH-]C2=CC=CC=C12`` ->
#               ``1,4-dihydronaphthalene-1,4-diide``.
#
# All four are CLOSED-SHELL (GetNumRadicalElectrons() == 0); the free-valence
# guard is untouched.

# Onium cation centre -> substituent-prefix base name (the ``-yl`` form of the
