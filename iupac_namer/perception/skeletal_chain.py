Skeletal replacement ("a") nomenclature for ACYCLIC chains (P-15.4.3 / P-51.4.1).

When an unbranched chain contains four or more skeletal *heterounits* together
with at least one carbon atom, and none of the heteroatoms constitute all or
part of a principal characteristic group, IUPAC requires the chain to be named
by skeletal replacement nomenclature rather than substitutively or
multiplicatively (P-51.4.1.1).  Examples:

    CCO[Te][Se]SCC  -> 3-oxa-6-thia-5-selena-4-telluraoctane   (PIN)
    COCCOCCOCCOC    -> 2,5,8,11-tetraoxadodecane               (PIN)
    COCOCOCOC       -> 2,4,6,8-tetraoxanonane                  (PIN)

The replacement parent hydride is the alkane whose chain length equals the
total number of skeletal atoms (carbons + heteroatoms).  Skeletal heteroatoms
are designated by nondetachable "a" prefixes (oxa, thia, selena, tellura, aza,
phospha, sila, ...) placed in front of the alkane name in seniority order
(P-15.4.1.2 / Appendix 1: O > S > Se > Te > N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge >
Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl), each with its locant(s).

Numbering is fixed (P-15.4.3.2.1): the chain is numbered from the end that
gives the lower locant set to the heteroatoms considered together as a set
without regard to kind; ties are broken by giving low locants to the
heteroatom(s) cited earliest in the seniority order.

CARBON-FREE chains take a different rule.  Replacement ("a") nomenclature above
requires at least one carbon (P-21.2.3.2); an all-heteroatom chain is instead a
*parent hydride*: a homogeneous one (P-21.2.2, e.g. trisulfane — produced by the
engine's homogeneous-heteroatom-chain dispatcher) or, when two heteroatoms
strictly alternate and the chain is terminated at both ends by the same
(less-senior) element, a heterogeneous ``a(ba)n`` parent hydride (P-21.2.3.1).
This module names the alternating case (:func:`_compute_alternating_heterochain`):

    SOS                   -> dithioxane           (HS-O-SH)
    [SiH3]S[SiH3]         -> disilathiane
    SOSOS                 -> trithioxane
    [SiH3]O[SiH2]O[SiH3]  -> trisiloxane

Nitrogen-containing heterogeneous chains use amine names (P-21.2.3.1 note) and
are NOT named by the alternating rule (declined here).

Scope of THIS module (the cleanly round-tripping common cases):
  - A single acyclic molecule (no rings, one fragment).
  - A saturated, unbranched main chain (no double/triple bonds, no branches).
  - Skeletal heteroatoms drawn from the standard-bonding-number replacement
    set with two-coordinate (O/S/Se/Te chalcogen), three-coordinate
    (N/P/As/Sb/Bi, B/Al/Ga/In/Tl) or four-coordinate (Si/Ge/Sn/Pb) standard
    valences only.
  - No charges, isotopes, radicals on skeletal atoms (terminal SiH3 etc. have
    no radical electrons in RDKit's model, so they pass).
  - No principal characteristic group anywhere on the molecule (an oxo/ol/etc.
    would change the numbering and unit count; deferred — see DOCUMENTED LIMITS
    in the build notes).
  - Heterounit count >= 4 (the P-51.4.1.1 threshold for the PIN).

Anything outside this scope returns ``None`` so the regular pipeline (which
already handles e.g. simple ethers substitutively) is used unchanged.
