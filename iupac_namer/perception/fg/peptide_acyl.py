==========================================

Naming round 9, item "peptide-acyl-naming" (admissions ledger slot 9,
target_source = "book:p.1048", P-103.2.5 / P-103.3.2).

**THE GAP.** Every one of B2's 20 rule-built dipeptides (20/20) named with
fully systematic substitutive nomenclature: glycylalanine came out
"2-[(2-amino-1-oxoethyl)amino]propanoic acid". The Blue Book retains the
"-yl" acyl form for the 20 proteinogenic amino acids when one acylates
another via the peptide bond -- P-103.3.2's own worked example is
"glycine + alanine -> glycylalanine (PIN)" (pdf p. 1048). Neither side of
that convention existed: no amino acid besides glycine had a retained
PARENT name (measured: alanine -> "2-aminopropanoic acid", not "alanine"),
and no amino-acid ACYL prefix existed at all.

**WHY A CLOSED TABLE, NOT A GENERAL RULE.** Unlike the linker-seniority
patches elsewhere in this round (_linker_has_imine, _linker_has_carbonyl,
_linker_has_phosphine_oxide -- structural checks that generalise to any
molecule with that shape), amino-acid retained names are a NAMED LIST: the
book retains exactly these 20 side chains, by exact structure, not by any
computable rule ("has an alpha-amino acid backbone" is not sufficient --
countless unnatural alpha-amino acids get no retained name at all). So this
module matches EXACT canonical structure, stereo included, against a table
of 20, the same closed-list shape as P-25.3.3's traditional ring numbering
tables in ring_naming/fusion_general.py's ``_TRADITIONAL``.

**STEREO IS PART OF THE MATCH, DELIBERATELY.** "Glycyl", "alanyl", etc.
denote the natural (L) series; the book's retained convention is for L-amino
acids specifically (P-103's own scope). Matching only by constitution (no
stereo check) would call a D-residue or an unspecified/racemic input
"alanyl" when it is not verifiably alanine at all -- exactly the kind of
unverified claim this project's convention (CLAUDE.md's "claims are
measured, not asserted") exists to prevent. A residue with under-specified
stereochemistry (measured: B2's own threonine and isoleucine dipeptide rows,
which carry stereo on the alpha carbon only, not the side-chain
stereocentre) is a KNOWN, DOCUMENTED miss, not a bug: this module correctly
declines rather than guess which diastereomer was meant.

**SCOPE.** Only a SINGLE peptide bond (a dipeptide) is handled: the base
residue's alpha-carboxyl must be free (a plain -C(=O)OH), matching every row
B2's battery actually tested. Tripeptides and longer chains, N-terminal or
C-terminal modification, and any residue outside the 20 natural ones all
fall through untouched -- this module is additive only, never declines an
otherwise-successful native plan.

# An amide nitrogen bonded to an sp3 alpha carbon: [N, alpha-C, acyl-C, =O,
# acyl-R]. `H0,H1` covers both base shapes this module handles -- an
# open-chain base residue's amine has exactly 1 H left after acylation
# (secondary amide, degree 2), while proline as the BASE (C-terminal)
# residue has 0: its ring nitrogen was already a secondary amine (2 ring
# bonds) before acylation, so acylating it makes a TERTIARY amide with no H
# at all (measured: histidylproline's own amide N is degree=3, H=0,
# in-ring). `_match_dipeptide` tells the two shapes apart and restores each
# correctly when cutting the bond. A free -NH2 (H2) or an already
# N,N-disubstituted amine base (not one of the 20) match neither and are
# correctly excluded here.
