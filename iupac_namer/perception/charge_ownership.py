"""Who owns each formally charged atom: exactly one route, or a declared hole.

Naming round 7 found a defect that lived in NO corpus: a carboxylate that also
carries a neutral OH was named as if the OH were the principal group. The cause
was not a wrong rule but a missing owner. ``_classify_acidic_anion`` deferred
that case to plan search ("mixed charged + neutral cases ... are deferred to the
standard plan-search path, which already handles them"), and plan search's
``_carved_acid_anion_sites`` excluded carboxylate ("handled by the dedicated
``_classify_acidic_anion`` path"). Each guard was right about its own half and
assumed the other guard covered the rest, so nothing did, and the charge fell to
an "oxido" prefix on the wrong parent.

This module makes ownership a MEASURED property instead of a comment:

* **structural class**, from the site itself (``_acidic_anion_site_kind``), not
  from any route: a carboxylate or sulfonate oxygen is an ``ACID_ANION`` site, an
  alkoxide or thiolate an ``OLATE_ANION`` site;
* **claimants**, from the real route predicates, never a copy of them: every
  classifier that yields a classification covering the atom (before the
  first-claimer-wins de-duplication, via ``classify_charges(claims_out=...)``),
  plus the plan search's two promotions: ``carved_anion`` when
  ``_carved_acid_anion_sites`` contains the atom, and ``fg_anion`` when FG
  perception detects an anion-variant group on it (the route that owns a
  zwitterion's carboxylate and a sulfinate, and is gated on net charge <= 0 as
  ``_name_bound`` gates it);
* **observed route**, from the real engine under ``diagnostics.capture()``: which
  classifier rendered, whether charge perception handed the molecule back to
  plan search and why, and which plan-search promotion (``carved_anion`` /
  ``fg_anion``) took it.

For a structural anion site the verdict is:

    OWNED         exactly one claimant, and the observed route agrees with it
    HOLE          no claimant -- the defect this module exists to see
    UNSUPPORTED   no claimant, and the class is in DECLARED_UNSUPPORTED with its reason
    OVERLAP       two claimants where no cascade is declared (an acid anion has
                  none), or two of the same tier; ordering, not design, picks
                  the winner. A declared cascade (a pure alkoxide is claimed by
                  the classifier first and the carved route second) is OWNED
    INCONSISTENT  one claimant, but the engine did not take that route

``semantic_owner`` is separate from the implementation route on purpose: it says
WHAT the class is (``ACID_ANION``), so a refactor that moves the logic to another
function cannot change ownership without changing the model.

Nothing here alters a name. It is read-only over the molecule, and the two hooks
it needed elsewhere (``classify_charges(claims_out=...)`` and
``diagnostics.record_route``) change no result.
